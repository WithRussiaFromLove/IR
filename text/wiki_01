Canada's next ambassador to U.S. instigates outrage over missile defense

, 
OTTAWA - Frank McKenna, Canada's next Ambassador to the U.S., announced Canada's partnership in the U.S.A.'s continental missile shield program. "We are part of it now," he said at a press conference in Ottawa.
Prime Minister Paul Martin has said there is no deadline, that Canada has not made a decision and will not until the matter has been debated, and Defense Minister Bill Graham agrees: "Canada's position is not a done deal."
Opposition parties expressed a range of responses on this hotly contested topic. Bloc Québécois MP Michel Gauthier charged "They don't want to tell the population that we've got our arm in the wringer of the washing machine and it's sucking us in." 
Stephen Harper, leader of the Conservative Party and a long-time proponent of the missile shield program, was angered by the Liberal Party's failure to live up to its promise to bring the issue up in parliament before any decisionmaking. "How could this prime minister secretly make this decision, so clearly breaking every commitment he's made to this house and to Canadians?"
The Canadian public is adamantly opposed to the missile defense, as they have shown in several polls. Martin's own party is on record opposing the installation of U.S. missiles in space or Canadian territory, so there were outcries from within the Liberal Party as well as from the opposition. 
Recent tests of the missile defense have failed, on February 14, 2005 and December 15, 2004. The next most recent test was more than two years earlier.

Australian government commits more troops to Iraq

Australian prime minister John Howard has admitted this week's decision to commit an additional 450 troops to Iraq is a policy backflip.
During the 2004 election campaign Mr Howard indicated that there would be no major increase in the number of Australian troops in Iraq. However yesteday's announcement is set to more than double the number of Australian troops on the ground in Iraq.
Mr Howard justified the reversal of policy as being in the "broader interests of democracy in the Middle East". He also explained that the decision came in response to requests from British and Japanese leaders.
The commitment of extra troops comes as a result of the Dutch government's decision to withdraw 1400 soldiers from Iraq, in response to political pressure in Holland.
The Australians will be deployed to the Iraqi province of Al Muthanna to provide military support for Japanese engineers working on reconstruction projects.

European Commission approves the accession of Bulgaria and Romania

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has publically-approved the accession of candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania, which are set to join the EU on January 1, 2007. The approval comes after Bulgaria and Romania completed accession negotiations in June and December respectively, and the text for the Accession Treaty was completed earlier this month.
The next step before accession will be the approval of the Accession Treaty by the on April 13, before the document is expected to be signed on April 25.
, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, who is from Finland, said that the EC's approval marks a new stage in the relations between the EU and the two candidate countries, and gives a clear message that the Commission welcomes Bulgaria and Romania into the European family.
However, Rehn also said that the two countries have a lot left to be done until their accession in less than two years. The release states that, "The Commission will continue to carefully monitor whether the two countries respect their engagements and obligations until accession and will support the two with all the instruments at its disposal."
Another important mention was that of the safeguard clause, which means that if any of the two countries do not meet their reform fulfillments and there are serious problems with their progress respecting their obligations, the EU can postpone accession by one year, to 2008.
The Romanian prime minister, , responded to the approval by saying that, "The EC approval for the Accession Treaty confirms Romania is fulfilling its commitments and that the country is on schedule with the integration process."

Romanian leu continues to surge

The leu, Romania's national currency, continues to appreciate against the euro and the US dollar after it reached high levels a few days ago. Yesterday, one euro could be bought for just 35,844 lei, down from 36,133 lei two days ago. These rates are also significantly stronger from the period in mid-2004 when the euro was worth more than 40,000 lei. Last week, the leu reached such a high rate against the euro that the National Bank of Romania had to intervene and restore the exchange rate back to around 37,000 lei per euro. The leu's growth also had an impact on global exchange rates, weakening the US dollar worldwide by 1%.
The National Bank, however, is hesitant to intervene in the marketplace once again due to the positive effects of the leu's appreciation on importers, who can now get products for lower prices, and for consumers, who now have higher purchasing power for imported goods. Romanians are also pleased that their currency, which has faced long periods of fairly sharp depreciation in the 1990s due to high inflation, is finally picking up again and strengthening against other currencies.
The leu's appreciation, however, isn't all positive, because it is putting a great deal of pressure on exporters. Other countries are finding Romanian exports more expensive, and therefore less competitive, due to the leu's appreciation, and this could widen the already large account deficit in the country.
Analysts predict, however, that the leu's surge cannot be stopped and it will continue strengthening against the euro, reaching a rate of 34,000 lei for one euro in the next week.
The current leu will be replaced in July 2005 with the New Leu (RON), with 10,000 old lei = 1 New Leu. The revaluation is expected to prepare Romania for adoption of the euro in 2012. Starting from next month, all Romanian prices must be shown in both the old currency and the new currency. The National Bank of Romania has said that it expects the exchange rate between the New Leu and the euro to hover at around 3.5 RON = 1 euro when the RON is introduced.

Dark matter galaxy discovered

Astronomers claim they have discovered the first galaxy made entirely of dark matter. 
The galaxy was found 50 million light years away using the University of Manchester's Lovell Telescope in Cheshire and confirmed with the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. 
While it contains mass that rotates like a normal galaxy, it contains no stars. Rather, it appears to entirely comprise dark matter, mysterious matter that differs greatly from the normal (baryonic) matter with which we're familiar. 
The discovery came from a five-year project to study the distribution of hydrogen atoms throughout the Universe. Hydrogen gas releases radiation that can be detected by radio telescopes. 
In the cluster of galaxies known as Virgo, an international team from the UK, France, Italy and Australia led by researchers at Cardiff University found hydrogen atoms amounting to 100 million times the mass of the Sun. 
They have named the find VIRGOHI21. 
The find is considered incredibly important because cosmological models suggest that dark matter is five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the Universe yet is difficult to study from Earth because of the planet's proximity to the Sun.
"The Universe has all sorts of secrets still to reveal to us, but this shows that we are beginning to understand how to look at it in the right way," says Jon Davies of Cardiff. "It's a really exciting discovery."

Effort on to eradicate Polio from Asia in 2005

, 
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has announced its goal to eradicate Polio from Asia in 2005. 
The 16 year old private-public project aims to add Poliomyelitis to the list of childhood diseases which have been eliminated. The World Health Organization, Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region.
In 2004 Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan cut their number of Polio cases by 45%. In 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100%.
The three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio, and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country. Only 186 cases were reported in 2004, down from 336 the previous year.

Mysterious power failure takes down Wikipedia, Wikinews

On Monday, at 10.14 pm UTC, the Wikimedia server cluster experienced a total power failure, taking down Wikipedia, Wikinews, and all other Wikimedia websites.
The servers are housed in a colocation facility (colo) in Tampa, Florida, USA. They occupy two racks, with each rack receiving electricity from two independent supplies. However, both supplies have circuit-breakers in them, and both opened at the same time, leading to a total power failure. All computers immediately went down. It's normal for fire safety regulations to prohibit uninterruptible power supplies in colos, with the colo providing its own UPS and generator instead. The circuit breakers were on the computer side of this emergency power system, so none of the computers continued to receive power to survive the breaker trip or shut down safely.
The actual reason why the circuit breakers tripped is currently unknown.
When power was restored, it was discovered that most of the MySQL databases that store the data which makes up Wikipedia et al had been corrupted. The main database and the four slaves had all damaged the data on their hard disk drives beyond the ability of the auto-correction to repair. Only one copy survived safely, on a machine that is used for report generation and maintenance tasks, which remained 31 hours backlogged while catching up after an unusually heavy update load during the previous week. 
Volunteer Wikimedia engineers worked through the night rebuilding the databases from the sole good copy onto the other servers. The Wikipedia database is over 180Gb in size, making the copying process last 1.5 - 2 hours for every server it was performed upon.
Regular back-ups of the database of Wikipedia projects are maintained - the encyclopedia in its entirety was "not" at risk. The last database download was made on February 9; all edits since then could only have been laboriously rebuilt from logs and recovered from the damaged database requiring much more time and effort.
Limited read-only service was established late Tuesday afternoon, with editing becoming possible 24 hours after the power failure. Final repairs continue now, as well as upgrades to prevent similar issues in the future. Server-intensive features, such as categories and 'watchlists' that display recent changes to selected articles to registered users, remain disabled to ease the load on the recovering systems.
The process which led to the damage originated with the operating system, disk controllers, or hard drives failing to flush the data correctly. 
If the power to a database server is cut mid-write, the database may be corrupted and unreadable, however the operating system, hardware, and software are designed to make this very unlikely. In a previous incident in 2004 power was also lost to a server but the database was undamaged.
To avoid such damage, each database server saves a copy of an edit to be applied to the database on a separate storage system before making the actual update to the database itself. This so-called 'write-ahead logging' should ensure that in the event of a system crash, the database can be rebuilt from a 'last-good' state by replaying the edits saved in the log. 
Earlier this year popular blogging site LiveJournal suffered a similar power failure when another customer at their colocation facility pressed an Emergency Power Off button, intended for use only by firefighters. The company suffered database corruption similar to that seen at Wikimedia. 
LiveJournal are now fitting UPS to their servers to ensure that they have time to shut down safely in the event of a power failure. Wikimedia was said to be investigating the possibility of fitting similar equipment at the time of this failure.
Several pundits have suggested that the use of another database, such as the proprietary database Oracle or the free PostgreSQL, would have avoided the database corruption seen at the server cluster. A post-mortem of the incident show the failure was in the operating system, or the hardware, or some combination of the two. LiveJournal, which also uses MySQL, reported similar database corruption after their power cut.
The Wikimedia foundation only allows the use of free software on its systems, and future versions of the Mediawiki software will support the PostgreSQL database.
Users are reminded that during times of system failure or excessive demand, they can still search Wikipedia using Google. The articles may be viewed using Google's cache.

Illegal dye found in British food

London, Dublin - The illegal food dye "Sudan Red 1", derived from chillies and banned in the EU since 2003, due to an associated risk of cancer has been found in several hundred products on European shelves. Products containing the illegal ingredient range from crisps, , casseroles and various chicken products to dozens of seasonings and sauces. The Italian food authorities found the illegal dye over routine checks, and thus alerted the British and subsequently the Irish authorities. 
The dye found its way into the European food supply as a primary ingredient in a batch of "Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce" ingredient manufactured in Britain by "Premier Foods", which was then used in all of the affected food products. As a result of the find over 400 products have been withdrawn in the UK and Ireland. The financial cost of recalling all the affected products in Britain alone is expected to top £100m, €145m.
Despite the recall many industry experts are trying to calm the public. One common analogy in use is, "Just like one cigarette is unlikely to cause cancer on its own, one meal containing Sudan Red is also unlikely to cause cancer." The problem is, if people regularly consume the dye, then the risk of cancer is greatly increased.
Which products are affected.
Several lists have been published by the UK and Irish food standard authorities. All products on the following lists contain the dye and should either be thrown out or returned to the shop where purchased:

Feverfew compound gets at leukemia roots

A compound in the common daisy-like plant feverfew kills human leukemia stem cells and could form the basis for newer, more effective drugs for the disease.
American researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York say that it could take months to develop a useable drug from the compound, parthenolide. 
However, they are working to do so with chemists at the University of Kentucky who have identified a water-soluble molecule with the same properties. The US National Cancer Institute has also accepted the work into its rapid access program, which aims to speed experimental drugs into human clinical trials. 
"This research is a very important step in setting the stage for future development of a new therapy for leukemia," says Rochester researcher Craig Jordan. "We have proof that we can kill leukemia stem cells with this type of agent, and that is good news."
Parthenolide appears to target the roots of myeloid leukemia, stem cells, while current treatments including the relatively new drug Gleevec don't. So, "You're pulling the weed without getting to the root," says Jordan. 
Used for centuries to fight fevers, inflammation and arthritis, feverfew earned interest from the Rochester researchers after other scientists showed that it could prevent skin cancer in animal models. 
So the researchers investigated how a concentrated form of the plant component parthenolide would affect leukemia cells and normal cells. 
Comparing the impact of parthenolide to the common chemotherapy drug cytarabine, they found that parthenolide selectively killed leukemia cells while sparing normal cells better. 
While the findings suggest that parthenolide is a good starting point for new drugs, people with leukemia aren't being encouraged to take high doses of feverfew as they could not take enough of the remedy to halt the disease. 
The research is reported in the journal "Blood".

Palestinian legislators approve new cabinet for Abbas

, 
Legislators in Ramallah have accepted a cabinet with few returning staff after twice rejecting Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia's more staid proposals.
"We have agreed in principle with Abu Mazen (Abbas) to let this crisis pass," Fatah MP Mohammed Horani said.
Members of the dominant Fatah party rejected two earlier line ups, before accepting the third late Wednesday after a further meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas. Fatah controls 63 of the 85 seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council.
The legislators were dismayed by a lack of change in the initial offerings, reportedly heavy with old guard politicians from the previous administration. Approximately 70% of the 24 cabinet members are new ministers that have not served before. Reports differ, with Reuters claiming 17 ministers are new, while the Times of London claims 20.
Nasser Yousef has been accepted to take the security forces roughly from behind, and Mohammed Dahlan, currently a security advisor to Abbas, is also in the new line up. Abbas is reported by the CBC as eager to consolidate control in security as part of an effort to clean up corruption and tighten domestic oversight in the occupied territories.
Some of the politicians who will not be a part of the new cabinet include Nabil Shaath, the Foreign Minister, and Saeb Erekat, the Negotiations Minister. 
The cabinet will now be brought to the Legislative Council on Thursday for a vote.

Pope John Paul II has been re-admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital with a relapse of influenza which saw him hospitalised earlier this month. 
He was wheeled into Gemelli Hospital on a partially elevated stretcher, and was waving to people as he entered the clinic.
Later, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls announced that the pope had undergone a tracheotomy to assist his breathing.
The Pope's re-admittance again raises questions about how long his papacy will last. One of his close aides refused to rule out the possibility of the Pope retiring saying it was up to his "conscience". The Pope has recently indicated that he has no intention of retiring by saying that the call "to guard his flock" was "particularly alive in him". 
The operation lasted around thirty minutes, and Navarro Valls said to media that it was a success.

Toothpaste fills cavities without drilling

A paste containing synthetic tooth enamel can seal small cavities without drilling. Kazue Yamagishi and colleagues at the FAP Dental Institute in Tokyo say that the paste can repair small cavities in 15 minutes.
Currently, fillers don't stick to such small cavities so dentists must drill bigger holes. Hydroxyapatite crystals, of which natural enamel is made, bond with teeth to repair tiny areas of damage. 
Yamagishi and colleagues have tested their paste on a lower premolar tooth that showed early signs of decay. They found that the synthetic enamel merged with the natural enamel. The synthetic enamel also appears to make teeth stronger which will improve resistance to future decay. As with drilling, however, there is still the potential for pain: The paste is strongly acidic to encourage crystal growth and causes inflammation if it touches the gums. 
The paste is reported in the journal "Nature".

Mutant gene predicts common Parkinson's

A genetic mutation has been linked with typical, late-onset Parkinson's in a step towards new drugs that target particular forms of the disease.
American and European researchers led by neuroscientists at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida discovered the mutation in a recently identified gene called LRRK2 that previous studies have already linked to some forms of Parkinson's.
The mutation, dubbed G2019S, is the first, the researchers say, to be associated with typical, late-onset Parkinson's. 
"From a research point of view, this is the first time we could identify what appears to be typical Parkinson's disease cases before people develop symptoms," says Mayo Clinic neuroscientist Matthew Farrer. "We know if someone inherits the mutation they are going to get Parkinson's disease."
The mutation was discovered by sequencing the LRRK2 gene in families with Parkinson's from the US, Norway, Ireland and Poland. 
It was found in 22 of 42 family members of people with Parkinson's while it was absent in more than 2,000 healthy controls. 
All people with G2019S mutations shared a genetic pattern indicating a common, ancient ancestor. 
The finding shows that the most common form of Parkinson's disease, which was thought to be sporadic, has a genetic component. 
While it's a small number of cases, says Farrer, theHouse Robber of Human Genetics".

Four are dead and fifty injured after a suicide bomber set off an explosion at a nightclub in central Tel Aviv. The blast was in the queue going into the club, Stage, on the main promenade. The bomber had been stopped from entering the club by security guards just before the explosion. 
At first the militant groups Hezbollah, al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Islamic Jihad and Hamas all denied involvement, but according to the BBC the Islamic Jihad later claimed responsibility for the blast. A spokesman for the group stated that "Israel has not abided by the pacification period. This is the main reason that led to this operation".
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas released a statement after a meeting with his security chiefs:
The swift condemnation and call for action by the Palestinian leader has caused Israeli officials to declare that the attack, the first since an informal truce began early this month, would not derail the peace process. It was also the first suicide bombing in Israel in almost 4 months, during which pullbacks from occupied territories have been announced, and Palestinian prisoners have been released.

Montserrat refugees to be deported from U.S.

A last gasp effort is underway to prevent the deportation of Montserratian refugees from New York City, U.S.A., to the disaster-stricken volcanic island they fled ten years ago.
Representative w:Major Owens (D, NY), of Brooklyn, is hoping the outpouring of support for victims of the Asian tsunami will save the refugees from returning to an island with an active volcano that is at constant risk of a further catastrophe.
Until last year, the Department of Homeland Security had allowed the families to stay in the United States under a special designation called “Temporary Protected Status”. But in July, secretary of homeland security, Tom Ridge, withdrew the status—not because it was safe to return to Montserrat, but because the volcano would remain active for decades to come and therefore was no longer a “temporary” danger. On February 27, the city’s estimated 100 Montserratians and their families will be forced to leave or risk deportation. A further 200 families, many of them living in Boston, are also under threat.
Earlier efforts to win a reprieve for the Montserratians were blocked by anti-immigrant forces in the House of Representatives, led by congressman Tom Tancredo, of Colorado, Rep. Owens said. But he added that a new bill, which he introduced at the end of last month, might be more popular in the wake of the Asian disaster.
“We hope that the approaching emergency situation plus the drama of the tsunami will help change some of the attitudes about this,” Rep. Owens said. “And some of the people who opposed this legislation on the basis that they opposed immigration, will see that it is not about immigration but about coming to the relief of people who have been victims of a natural disaster.”
Meanwhile, New York’s tiny Montserratian community must wait and hope. For those not fortunate enough to have married a US citizen or to have found an employer willing to sponsor them, the coming weeks are crucial.
Pearl Ryner, 40, a refugee who works as a medical technician at the King’s County Hospital in Brooklyn, said she refused to get married just so that she can stay in the United States. But she is a single mother with four children and she does not want to uproot her family and start over again.
“I worry. I cry. I am still hoping,” Ms. Ryner said. “What do I do? Where do I begin? How do I pick four kids up and take them away? If I buy a plane ticket, where do I go? These are questions that I do not have an answer for.”
The Department of Homeland Security has suggested that because Montserrat is a British overseas territory, Montserratians should go to the UK. But the refugees say they have no relatives or friends they can stay with in the UK, and that they have made homes and started careers and lives in the United States.
If the refugees are deported to Montserrat it will be to a 35 square-mile island, two-thirds of which is buried beneath volcanic rubble and ash. The capital, Plymouth, in the south east of the island has been abandoned, and there is a housing and employment shortage.
The Soufriere Hills Volcano erupted in 1995, but the British Foreign Office website warns that the volcano remains active. Heavy rain can cause mudflows, and people suffering from breathing problems risk airborne dust and volcanic ash. The collapse of a lava dome in 2001 spewed clouds of ash that affected Puerto Rico, a self-governing territory of the United States, 200 miles away.
Moreover continued volcanic activity is triggering landslides that have caused two tsunamis in Montserrat during the past ten years. The first, on December 26, 1997, created a wave three meters tall, which rolled northwards along the coast. The second, in July 2003, measured about four meters and traveled to Guadeloupe 30 miles away.
Sherry Coriette, 28, who works for a major retail company in New York, said that she still has not decided what to do. “I have a good job, I pay my bills,” Ms. Coriette said. “Eight years ago I left with nothing and now I am having to face starting all over again.”
Matthew Dunn, chairman of the New York Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that as long as there was a potential for danger, the United Sates should offer the people of Montserrat a safe haven.
“I would argue that is what our country is all about: helping and protecting people,” Mr. Dunn said. “But the biggest shame in all of this is that because there is so few of them, they do not have a big enough voice.”

U.N. reports Afghan opium production is up again

&lt;br&gt;
Afghanistan is the #1 producer of in the world — responsible for 87% of all illicit opium production — according to reports from the United Nations (UNODC), and its opium production has accelerated since the coalition invasion in 2001.
The November 2004 annual reports put out by UNODC show that Afghanistan opium production has been increasing each year since the coalition invasion. The UNODC report for 2004 shows a 64% increase over the previous year in the area of opium production, and a 22% increase in export value for the year(2.8 billion).
"It could be brought under control with a good dose of law enforcement, which at the moment is lacking," Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of UNODC, said in an interview in 2003 when reports showed an increase in hectares under production of 8% over the previous year. "I believe that the war against terrorism, leaving aside addiction, will not be won unless we control the opium economy of Afghanistan."
Doug Wankel, Counter Narcotics Coordinator at the U.S. Embassy in , said the opium industry in Afghanistan is financing terrorism in an interview with USA Today. "It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."
Calling the data "disheartening," UNODC reported that Afghanistan now produces three-fourths of the world's opium. The report estimated revenues from growing and trafficking to be half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.

Bacteria thrive deep under sea floor

Analysis of sediments taken from hundreds of metres beneath the ocean floor
has shown them to contain living microbes. According to a study produced
by a team of researchers supported by the International Ocean Drilling
Program, this is the first time that microbes have been found in abundance at such depths.
Scientists have long speculated about how much of the bacterial content of
the sediments is biologically active. Techniques used to stain the bacteria and
identify them could not previously discriminate between live and dead
cells. For this study a new technique that could distinguish between alive
and dead cells was used.
The results were surprising. The sediments, some of which had been
collected from up to 800 metres from beneath the sea floor and
are said to be up to 16 million years old, contained between 10-30% living
bacteria. Scientists estimate that between 60-70% of all bacteria are
living deep beneath the surface, far from any sunlight.
"We didn't have clear evidence that bacteria there were alive until now,"
said ecologist and team member Lev Neretin of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Biology
in Bremen, Germany. According to calculations,
the populations of bacteria multiply at the same rate as their surface
cousins and contribute significantly to the balance of greenhouse gases,
consuming and producing CO2. They also contribute methane via a metabolic
process that does not require oxygen.
"Because they play such a major role in the biochemical processes in the
subsurface, clearly they are driving lots of reactions that produce the
chemical steady state on Earth," said Dr John Parkes, one of the original
co-authors of the paper which appeared in Nature magazine, "possibly we
might not have oil and gas formations without them."
How could these bacteria get so deep beneath the ocean floor? "The only
reasonable way is for them to be buried there," says Bo Thamdrup, a
microbiologist from the University of Southern Denmark, Odense. The
extremes of temperature and pressures tolerated by these bacteria add
weight to the assertion that microbes may flourish in the extreme
conditions of other planets.
"It is well known that bacteria living in deep oceans have special
adaptations to help them survive," says Thamdrup. "I'm sure these bacteria
have special adaptations too." A full genetic analysis may soon reveal
them.

Suspect in BTK killings arrested after 25 years in hiding

Wichita Police today arrested Dennis Rader, who is suspected of being the BTK killer. BTK, an acronym for "Bind, torture, kill," was the name the serial killer gave himself after killing eight people between 1974 and 1986 in that manner. The killer was thought to have disappeared for 25 years before he resurfaced in March of 2004. He was later linked to two unsolved murders, which took place in 1985 and 1991. Police Chief Norman Williams publicly announced the guilt of Mr. Rader prior to any trial preparations when he said to reporters "The bottom line, BTK is arrested."
The commander of the task force investigating the BTK killings, Lt. Ken Landwehr, said Rader had been arrested after being pulled over in a routine traffic stop. Authorities had questioned a "person of interest" Friday, which led them to a Park City home just outside Wichita and eventually to the identity of BTK.
BTK was notorious not only for his brutal way of killing people, but for taunting police and other investigators with letters throughout his 12-year killing spree. Investigators had run out of leads until police received a letter from BTK in March of last year.
Police have said they charge Rader with eight counts of first-degree murder and two other homicide charges. According to CNN, police were able to use Rader's daughter's DNA to find Rader. DNA of close family members has been used in a few previous cases to identify suspects, through a new technique known as familial searching.

Princeton media class discusses Wikinews

According to Ryan Walsh, editor of the websites for both the Princeton Journal of Science and American Foreign Policy, internet news service Wikinews was the topic of a report by Federico Baradello in a Princeton University course on mass media and public policy. The course, offered through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, studies "the impact of policy on the content, presentation, influence, and technology of a rapidly-evolving 21st century news media," according to the school.
Walsh, currently a junior at Princeton, characterized the report in an to Wikinews user Pingswept as "great" and added that "everyone in the class seemed to enjoy learning about Wikinews, and Federico was a great speaker."
According to an from Baradello, the report, which took place on Monday, 21 February 2005, provided a "basic overview of its history (evolution), ownership, viewership, and position in the news market." It included a live demonstration of adding new content to Wikinews. The barebones content provided in the demonstration was developed into this article.
Baradello's report is available on the course's blog. His final course paper on the decentralization of news gathering includes a case study on Wikinews with commentary from Jimmy Wales and will be available in PDF form by late May.

Founder of Amnesty International dies, aged 83

The founder of Amnesty International, Peter Benenson, passed away last night after suffering for some time from a serious illness. At age 83, it is forty four years since he founded Amnesty as a result of reading an article about the imprisonment of two students in Portugal who had drunk a toast to liberty. 
Amnesty International said they will be holding a public memorial service and there will be private ceremony for family members however there will be no funeral service. Amnesty International's current Secretary-General, Irene Khan, said after his death: "Peter Benenson's life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice around the world."
The organisation was initially formed in 1960 for "a one-year campaign for the release of six prisoners of conscience." Today Amnesty has over 1.8m members and campaigns for human rights on a global basis. Mr. Benenson was originally trained as a lawyer before he dedicated his life to the promotion of human rights.

 One of the biggest domestic banks in the United States, Bank of America, has admitted to losing computer tapes containing 1.2 million federal employee accounts, including the accounts of several U.S. senators, in a statement by the bank. According to the Pentagon, most of the accounts belong to staff and civilians in the Department of Defense. The bank said the tapes were lost in December 2004 as they were being transported to a data back-up centre by a commercial plane.
Currently, the U.S. are looking in to the matter, a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime such as this. All parties concerned are worrying about possible identity theft as it contained valuable information such as bank account numbers, names and addresses.

Romania announces 18 percent increase in tourists in 2004

 6.6 million tourists visited Romania in 2004, marking an 18% increase over 2003, announced the National Authority for Tourism (ANT). This was one of the highest rates of tourism growth in Europe. However, it remains slightly below the number of Romanians who spent their holidays in other countries throughout 2004 - a figure of 6.9 million.
Carmen Moraru, the promotion and marketing director at ANT said that many tourists came as part of holiday packages or tours, organised around the regions of Maramureş, Transylvania, Moldova, the Prahova Valley and the Danube Delta.
In 2005, the number of tourist arrivals is set to rise further, mainly due to a Romanian promotion campaign launched across Europe. The country's tourist revival is mainly due to its diversity - it is home to Europe's largest delta, the Black Sea Coast with its resorts, the Carpathian Mountains with their skiing and winter activities, Transylvania with its ecotourism, agritourism and beautiful landscapes, as well as the medieval history of cities like Sibiu and Sighişoara.

Cambridge Planning Board approves new science building at Harvard

The planning board of Cambridge, Massachusetts voted in unanimous approval of Harvard University's plan to build a 410,000 ft² (38 090 m²) science center at 24 Oxford Street, according to the local newspapers, the Harvard Crimson and the Cambridge Chronicle. More than half of the space in the building will be constructed underground.
The Northwest Science Building, as it will be called, will house the laboratories of roughly 30 Harvard science faculty members, as well as a chilled water plant and an electrical substation. The building was designed by Craig Hartman, an architect in the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, who also completed Harvard University Master Plan in 2002, according to the firm's website. Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill also designed such notable buildings as Chicago's Sears Tower and the recently completed international terminal at the San Francisco airport.
The vote to approve the plan occurred at the February 15, 2005, meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board at the City Hall Annex, 344 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge. In what the Harvard Crimson called a "departure from the norm," there were no comments from residents at the hearing. The Crimson reported that the Harvard officials at the meeting took this as "a signal that the community was well-informed about the project prior to the presentation." The sign advertising the hearing can be seen at right.
In related news, the Director of Urban Design for Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill's New York office, Vishaan Chakrabarti, will be speaking at the Harvard Graduate School of Design on March 1, 2005.

 Ireland has beaten England in a very close game of rugby at Dublin's Lansdowne Road in today's Rugby Union Six Nations Championship clash.
Ireland got off to a perfect start, despite having to play against the wind; with a drop goal by Ronan O'Gara putting the homeside 3 points up after just four minutes. But due to some awful defence by the Irish, England too the lead with a try by Martin Corry and Charlie Hodgson had no trouble converting to put England ahead by four points. Ronan O'Gara quickly got another 3 point from a drop goal to bring the score to 7-6 in favour of England. Two minutes later England went behind after a successful Irish penalty. England went ahead again at twenty five minutes with a penalty from Hodgson after a dry spell of fifteen minutes for the visitors. Ireland earn't a hard fought drop goal just after the half hour mark by Ronan O'Gara. 
At half time, Ireland were just marginally ahead at 12-10. Eight minutes into the second half, Ireland missed a chance to go five clear when an O'Gara penalty went wide. Hodgson got his third score with a drop goal at fifty seven minutes to bring England anhead by one point. However their lead was short lived as a Brian O'Driscoll try and subsequent conversion by Ronan O'Gara put the Irish ahead 19-13. Despite numerous strong attacks in the last fifteen minutes, England failed beat the Irish defense.
Ronan O'Gara was the "RBS Man of the Match"

An Egyptian baby, born with two heads, is recovering after a successful operation to remove the second head in Cairo on Thursday.
The ten-month old baby was suffering from a condition known as Craniopagus parasiticus, which is a medical condition where an undeveloped, parasitic twin head is attached to the body of a developed twin.
The second head was said to be able to smile and blink, but was not capable of independent life.
Manar Maged underwent a thirteen hour operation to have the head removed. There have only been eight cases of this condition recorded. A baby suffering from it underwent a similar operation in the Dominican Republic in February 2004 but did not survive.
Baby Manar is doing well and shows no signs of paralysis. It is expected that she will remain in intensive care for at least a week.

Four people died in the fire, including two employees of the tower. The body of a security officer was found on the 18th floor with another body found nearby. Two more were found in an elevator. Two or three people suffered minor injuries after inhaling smoke.
The building in Taichung, Taiwan's third largest city, houses offices, shops and schools.
Those fleeing the building at ground level had to cover their heads to protect themselves from falling glass and other debris. Fire fighters extinguished the blaze after an hour and a half.

He rejected rumours that the value added tax, which is applied to most goods and services, will increase due to negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and a need to boost government revenue.
After introducing a low flat tax rate of 16% on January 1, 2005, which applies to both personal income and corporate profits, the government has had to fund the tax cuts through alternative means, including increases in other types of taxation, to avoid running a high budget deficit. For example, from April 1, the government will increase as well as a range of other taxes. Despite the increase, Romania continues to have one of the lowest fiscal burdens in Europe due to the new 16% flat tax rate.

Rare antibody yields AIDS vaccine insight

A rare antibody has yielded insight into creating an effective AIDS vaccine. 
Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California and several other institutions say that the neutralizing antibody broadly defuses HIV. 
Neutralizing antibodies are secreted into the bloodstream following exposure to a virus, where they bind to viral particles, prevent them from infecting cells and spur their destruction. Because neutralizing antibodies attack viruses before they enter cells, they could form the basis for effective AIDS vaccines if present before exposure to HIV. But while the body makes many antibodies against HIV, they are usually unable to neutralize the virus. Some people, however, do produce effective neutralizing antibodies for HIV. 
Dennis Burton of Scripps and colleagues have now described the structure of one of these, called 4E10. In tests, the antibody neutralized nearly 100 strains of HIV from around the world. 
Isolated about a decade ago from an HIV-infected person by study coauthor Hermann Katinger of the Institute for Applied Microbiology of the University of Agriculture in Vienna, Austria, the antibody shows what type of structure can neutralize HIV. 
It appears that 4E10 targets an area on the HIV surface protein GP41 that the virus uses to fuse its membrane to a human cell's membrane during infection. 
Because the antibody's structure shows what this area on HIV's surface looks like, it provides scientists with a template for reverse-engineering components for AIDS vaccines. 
The research is reported in the journal Immunity.

Bomb blast kills Iraqi police, army recruits

A suicide car bombing in al Hilla, south of Baghdad, has killed 125 people, mostly Iraqi applicants for police and army waiting for medical exams becoming the worst single event since the initial invasion. At nearly the same time another car bomb exploded in Musayyib, 30km north of Hilla.
The attack occurred about 8:30 a.m. local time Monday, in a crowd of mostly Shi'a recruits applying for positions with the country's security forces, and as citizens were arriving at the nearby outdoor market.
The recruits were waiting for required medical exams at a clinic across from the mayor's home and the market. Shoppers in the market, men, women and children, were among the dead from the blast.
There are conflicting reports regarding the Musayyib explosion, with some reports indicating only the bomber died and others suggesting a police officer also dying from the blast.
Babil province police released a statement regarding the blast, reporting several arrests were made after but not elaborating further.
Attacks by the insurgency forces appear to have increased in deadliness. Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said Monday at a news conference in Baghdad "the number of casualties is much more than before."
al Hilla was the scene of a major battle in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with several hundred Iraqi forces reported to have been killed in fierce fighting. The city is now included in the Polish military zone under the occupation of Iraq.

New flood warning system introduced in Romania

 Hidroelectrica, Romania's largest hydroelectricity company, has introduced a new flood warning system, according to the Romanian Ministry of the Economy and Commerce. The system will be installed at the hydroelectric power station in Bistriţa, and will include 52 sound flood warning stations on the Bistriţa River Valley. They will warn individuals by code signals in case of a flood alert. The system will be tested on in the following two days.
Especially in the Bistriţa region, floods continue to be quite a frequent problem, even though they are not particularly severe.

British investors are increasingly interested in Romania

 The number of businessmen from the United Kingdom who intend to invest in Romania has doubled this year in comparison to 2004, showing that the country is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for British investors.
Quinton Quayle, the UK's ambassador in Romania, said at a conference held by the Romanian-British Chamber of Commerce that there are approximately 20 British companies investing in Romania this year, but would not reveal more information.
Brian Davies, president of the British company Sanders Polyfilms, which currently has operations in Romania, claims that investors from the UK come to the country not only for the local market, which is the second-largest in Central and Eastern Europe, but also because Romania could be a great export centre to other markets in the region.
Other factors that make Romania attractive are a low flat tax rate of 16% on personal income and corporate profits, as well as a skilled, English-speaking workforce. 
So far, companies from the United Kingdom have invested $1.2 billion in Romania. Romania's total foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2004 was 4.1 billion euro. Besides the UK, other large investors in Romania are Austria, Italy, Germany and France.
Relations between the UK and Romania have been boosted recently as a result of the Romanian president, Traian Băsescu, making a visit to London earlier in the year. During his election campaign last year, Băsescu said that he wanted to create a London-Bucharest-Washington axis, accenting the importance of Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Romania's ties to the UK are also important as the UK will hold the EU's rotating presidency from July to December 2005, at a crucial stage of Romania's preparations for EU accession, which is expected to occur in 2007.

Jermaine Pennant jailed for drink-driving

 The Arsenal F.C. midfielder Jermaine Pennant, currently on loan to Birmingham City, has today pleaded guilty to drink-driving, driving while disqualified, and driving without insurance by Aylesbury magistrates court. Pennant received a sentence of three months imprisonment. Pennant's lawyer, Bary Warbutton, has said that the footballer will appeal against the severity of the sentence.
The incident occurred on January 23 of this year, Pennant was arrested after crashing teammate Ashley Cole's car into a lamppost. The 22-year-old claimed that he crashed the car after attempting to operate the car's Satellite navigation system.
Despite the claim by Warbutton that imprisonment "could completely destroy his career", Birmingham City have said that they will stand by the player, and help to rehabilitate him. Arsenal released a statement saying that the sentence would not impact the player's future with the club; his contract with club expires in the summer, at the same time as his loan-spell with Birmingham ends.

Controversial melatonin supplements confirmed as sleep aid

An analysis of melatonin studies has upheld the controversial supplement's effectiveness as a sleep aid. 
The analysis, which included 17 peer-reviewed scientific papers, was aimed at determining whether supplements of the hormone can improve sleep among insomniacs, older adults and others. 
"A meta-analysis essentially tells 'yes' or 'no'—that a treatment does or does not have a significant effect," says Richard Wurtman of MIT, the study's principal investigator. "When a meta-analysis says 'yes,' there should no longer be any controversy about whether the treatment works." 
Previous studies by Wurtman and colleagues showed that small doses of melatonin, about 0.3 milligrams, are necessary for restful effects. The researchers found, however, that commercially available melatonin pills can contain 10 times the effective amount. 
At that dose, says Wurtman, the hormone's effects end after a few days because melatonin receptors in the brain become unresponsive when exposed to too much of the hormone. 
Such inadvertent overdosing, say the researchers, has contributed to controversy over melatonin's efficacy. 
But the new meta-analysis shows that melatonin does indeed have positive effects on sleep—even though some of the analyzed studies also involved high doses of the hormone. 
The research is reported in the journal "Sleep Medicine Reviews".

Researchers from the UK have shown that a chemical in the tea reduces cell death following such incidents, which in turn could fight tissue death and organ failure. 
Led by Anastasis Stephanou, the researchers showed in heart cells that the chemical (EGCG) inhibits cell death, apparently by blocking the action of a protein called Star 1. 
This protein is activated in cells after a stressful event and contributes to inducing cell death. 
EGCG also appears to speed recovery of heart cells to spur tissue recovery. 
Stephanou says that while the researchers are "extremely encouraged" by the findings, more research is necessary before people are advised to drink green tea after heart attack or stroke.

Elan; Biogen withdraw multiple sclerosis drug after death

Élan, the largest Irish pharmaceutical company, and its partner Biogen have withdrawn the multiple sclerosis drug "Tysabri" from clinical trials after the death of a patient. The drug was seen by many as a possible blockbuster drug with the potential to alleviate much of the suffering of the millions of multiple sclerosis suffers worldwide. However it is now quite unlikely that it will ever make it to market.
The news has seen the shares of both companies fall steeply, with Élan having lost almost 70% of its value after Monday's announcement. Two years ago Élan was the largest Irish PLC, with a value in excess of $20bn, but an accountancy scandal saw its shares fall from over €73 to €1.50 within a few weeks. Since then the stock had risen back to trade between €16 and €18 a share on the back of good restructuring news. However the withdrawal of "Tysabri" leaves Elan with almost no potential future revenue streams.
Biogen shares which had hit a 52 week high of $70 just two weeks before the announcement have since fallen to just $41.26. Combined equity losses on Monday for the two firms was over $17.8 billion.
The paitent who died had been taken in combination with another drug - "Avonex" - for the last two years. If it emerges that the death was as a result of taking "Avonex", then it is possible "Tysabri" could be re-introduced to the market. However for the moment rivals will be seeking to steal a lead in the potentially lucrative MS drug market.

Britain unveils flu pandemic preparedness plan, buys 14m courses of treatment drug

The government of the United Kingdom has unveiled their strategy to deal with any future influenza in their Pandemic Influenza Contingency Plan.
The document, based on the World Health Organization's framework for responses, explains how the UK would respond to a major outbreak of flu. 
Any flu pandemic would differ from the seasonal outbreaks of flu observed worldwide every year. While seasonal flu kills 12,000 Britons annually, a pandemic would affect far more people and could result in the deaths of up to 50,000 people in the UK if there were no medical intervention.
The government will have the power to cancel events where large numbers of people gather, such as football (soccer) matches. It could also advise travel restrictions to and from areas of high infection, but would not be able to enforce any such measures.
Schools might be closed in the event of a flu pandemic, and infected people would be asked to remain at home, although again no measures could be imposed by the government.
Further plans include education of the public to recognize symptoms of the flu and how to avoid infection.
Measures will be made to maintain basic services in the event of a pandemic despite staff absences through illness.
A major cornerstone of the plan is the prescription of oseltamivir, an oral neuraminidase inhibitor drug that combats influenza. The drug is currently marketed by Hoffman La Roche under the trade name Tamiflu®. 
The UK Department of Health intends to stockpile 14.6m courses of the drug over the next two financial years, giving enough to treat one in four of the population - the ratio recommended by the WHO. 
Canada and Australia have also bought the equivalent amounts of anti-viral drugs. The U.S. has also bought large amounts of similar drugs.
The total cost of the acquisition was not published by the government, but the BBC estimated the cost to be £180 million.
Unlike a vaccine, oseltamivir can be used to treat any strain of the influenza virus. Many new variants of the influenza virus are seen every year, and combined with the long lead times associated with the development of vaccinces, mass vaccination is frequently impractical.
Some parts of the newly-revealed plan already exist. The UK government recently gave £500,000 to the WHO for survellience of so-called 'bird flu' in South East Asia, a possible source for any future pandemic. The Department of Health will also continue to monitor flu-like cases seen by doctors and hospitals.
Background on Influenza, from Wikipedia.
Influenza is an extremely variable disease; similar viruses are found in pigs and domestic fowl. In areas where there are high concentrations of humans, pigs and birds in close proximity, such as parts of Asia, simultaneous infections across species enable genetic material to be exchanged between the various strains of flu. This appears to be the principal method by which new infectious strains arise. 
It is believed that sooner or later, a recombination may occur to produce a strain as lethal as the 1918 virus. In late 1997, a new strain of avian influenza (also known as bird flu) originating from chickens infected 18 people in Hong Kong, of whom 6 died. This strain did not appear to be readily transmissible from human to human, but such a high mortality rate, and the possibility of a further recombination to make it more infectious, meant that the risk was considered so great that all domestic poultry in Hong Kong was slaughtered. Avian influenza transmissible to humans resurfaced in January 2004 in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand.
There were several serious outbreaks of influenza in the 20th century. The most famous (and the most lethal) was the Spanish Flu pandemic (type A influenza, H1N1 strain), which lasted from 1918 to 1919 and is believed to have killed more people in total than World War I. Lesser flu pandemics included the 1957 Asian Flu (type A, H2N2 strain) and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu (type A, H3N2 strain).
Although there were scares in New Jersey in 1976 (the Swine Flu), worldwide in 1977 (the Russian Flu), and in Hong Kong in 1997 (Avian influenza), there have been no major pandemics subsequent to the 1968 infection. Increased immunity from antibodies and the development of flu vaccines have limited the spread of the virus and so far prevented any further pandemics.

Ernst Zündel expelled from Canada

White supremacist and Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel was expelled from Canada and arrived in Germany today. A Federal Court judge ruled that his anti-Semitic activities were "not only a threat to Canada's national security, but also a threat to the international community of nations."
In a press release given by B'nai Brith Canada, executive vice president Frank Dimant said that "For decades Zundel has spewed his venom and imbued his brand of hate in a new generation of white supremacist groups that had made him a hero ... Zundel's day of reckoning has finally come." Canadian Jewish Congress National President Ed Morgan was quoted as saying that “this is a significant day for the Jewish community (of Canada) and for all those who treasure tolerance in a multicultural society ... Zundel’s departure demonstrates Canada’s abhorrence for those who would propagate Holocaust denial and antisemitism. It brings closure to our efforts to bring this man to justice." 
Zündel's Toronto lawyer, Peter Lindsay, said Zündel is "very disillusioned about the process and about being the victim of a secret trial, and now being deported based on evidence he's never seen."
Upon arriving in Germany, Zündel, 65, was immediately taken into custody by authorities on the grounds that he was running a web site denying the existence of the Holocaust, which is a crime in that country. Prosecutors in the city of Mannheim have issued a warrant for his arrest according to the Associated Press. A spokeswoman for the federal Justice Ministry, on condition of anonymity, said authorities were able to open a case against Zundel because his Holocaust-denying site can be accessed in Germany.
In 1977, Zündel founded a small press publishing house called Samisdat Publishers which issued such pamphlets as "The Hitler We Loved" and "Why and Did Six Million Really Die?" by Richard Harwood aka Richard Verrall (a British neo-Nazi leader) as well as booklets claiming that UFOs were actually Nazi secret weapons operated from secret Nazi military bases in Antarctica. Zundel lived in Canada for 42 years as a landed immigrant. His last two years were spent in a Toronto jail, where he was held under the Canadian security certificate law. The law was passed after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, and allows the Canadian government to hold suspects of terrorism without charge, based on secret evidence that does not have to be disclosed to a suspect or his defense.

 The city centre of Bucharest, the capital of Romania, is set to get a major facelift due to a real estate project called "Esplanada" (The Esplanade), which will be constructed by TriGranit Development Corporation. The total investment in the project will be greater than 800 million euro and aims to build a modern commercial pedestrian area in downtown Bucharest, with several shopping malls, office buildings, hotels and dwellings. It will be the largest real estate program in Romania since the fall of Communism in 1989.
Bucharest is currently looking at possibilities to improve its appearance and rebrand itself as a lively, creative and vibrant city. Many initiatives have sprung up to improve the city, including the organisation of CowParade later this year. Additionally, the old town centre will be restored. Due to Romania's current economic boom, several other major construction projects are taking place.
Bucharest City Hall has blocked traffic in the city center due both to the old town restoration and to the "Esplanada" project.

First Swahili office suite released in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

On Monday, February 28, 2005, Jambo OpenOffice.org, the first Swahili office suite, was released at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. The office suite was translated from the English version of OpenOffice.org, an open source suite based on Sun Microsystems' StarOffice. Jambo OpenOffice.org was translated by a multinational team including Swedish and Spanish programmers, as well as linguists from the University of Dar es Salaam. Monday's release included builds for Linux and Windows.
The office suite has four components: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation creator, and a drawing program. The translation effort required translating 18,000 English strings, made up of one or more words, many of which have previously had no direct Swahili equivalent. As part of the translation, the team developed a glossary of 1500 technical words in Swahili. The office suite also includes a spellchecker with a lexicon of 70,000 words.
Swahili is not the only African language into which OpenOffice is being translated. According to Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, OpenOffice is being translated into nine official languages of South Africa by Translate.org.za. The same organization is also supporting translation efforts to bring the software into the Rwandan language Kinyarwanda, and Hausa, a language spoken largely in Nigeria.
Swahili is spoken by approximately 55 million people worldwide, predominantly in East African countries, including Tanzania and Kenya.
Interview with the project coordinator
"Replies to questions from by Alberto Escudero-Pascual, March 3, 2005"
 &gt; 1. Is the suite 100% translated to Swahili now?
The suite contains more than 99% of the strings in Swahili. The ones
that are left in English (less than 100 strings out of 18,000) will
be worked out in the next release. Yes, this release is fully functional
in Swahili.
 &gt; 2. What would people who speak only Swahili 
 &gt; do before Monday's release if they needed a 
 &gt; word processor? Are there any alternatives?
No alternatives. This is the first ever release of a word processor in Swahili.
 &gt; 3. How widely do you expect the suite to be distributed? 
 &gt; What sort of IT infrastructure exists in East Africa?
I "expect" the software to get installed in all the primary schools of
the country. I also expect the software to be installed in the main
universities of the country and colleges. We have postive feedback
from them but this is a rather "political" decision out of my (our)
control.
The secondary schools have compulsory English so they might not want
to install it.
East Africa, ufff that is like asking what IT infrastructure is in the
whole Europe :-D
If you mean connectivity, all is satellite VSAT upstreams. Most of
the local loops in Dar are based on IEEE 802.11b. It is expensive for
most of the locals. But there is an Internet Exchange already in Dar es Salaam
where the ISP peer together. Things will always get
better. The software is placed in the IX.
The software will spread slowly, but I am sure that will spread.
 &gt; 4. What next? How many words are there to translate 
 &gt; in a small Linux distribution like Knoppix?
The Tanzanian team will start translating OOo training documentation,
and next they will work with Firefox. A Linux desktop might come next
year.
I have no idea what will it take to translate Knoppix, but the
priorities should be in getting first a couple of good tools as
OpenOffice and Firefox and do loads and loads of training material in
Swahili.
 &gt; 5. How will future versions be compiled once you 
 &gt; return to Sweden?
I have developed an almost automatic version to update JambOOo 1.1.3 in
Kiswahili. The UDSM has access to one of the build servers. I expect a
new release of JambOO, maybe 1.1.4 with all the bug corrections in six
months. The next step is to migrate to OOo 2.0, I have no clear
picture of how that will happen.
 &gt; Will it all come through one copy of Visual Studio
 &gt; in Dar es Salaam?
Nope, the Win32 version was developed entirely in Sweden and Spain during
Christmas 2004 . The new build system does not require Visual Studio
to "update" the Swahili strings.
 &gt; 6. How was the project funded? How can people contribute to this
 &gt; project, or similar projects in the future?
SIDA (Swedish International Cooperation Agency) has funded the
University of Dar es Salaam and the Institute of Kiswahili Research
for one full year. My company IT+46 also was funded by SIDA to support
the project technically.
IT+46 has contributed 50% of its working-time at no cost to the project.
 &gt; 7. What is the plan for IT +46?
Our plan was to be in Tanzania only six months and handle all the
technology and the training back to the university as we want them to
keep on with the development by themselves. Now, we are trying to find
similar projects that need support. There are many languages out there
after all.

Martin firm on missile defence results in chilly response from White House

Senior Canadian officials said Tuesday that U.S. president George W. Bush has not returned a telephone call Paul Martin made to him last week, due to the Canadian government's decision to not participate in the U.S. missile defence initiative.
The Prime Minister was hoping explain Canada's reasons for saying no.
Although the White House has formally stated it's "disappointment" on the decision, it also stated that Bush would likely talk with Martin on the issue when the two meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox on March 23 to discuss the future of NAFTA, the North American free trade agreement.
A Martin spokesperson told the "Toronto Star" that "the decision to not participate (in ballistic missile defence) ... was Canada's alone to take ... The Bush administration, while disappointed in the decision, recognizes that fact and is not seeking apologies." The CanWest News Service reported that another Martin spokesperson, Melanie Gruer, played down the reports by saying that "The President has been travelling," and that Prime-minister Martin's aides acknowledge the pressures on busy leaders' schedules. 
U.S. officials had mentioned that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's decision to postpone a visit to Ottawa was in response to the non-participation decision. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew spoke twice to Ms. Rice, finally ensuring that she will come to Canada as planned, despite concerns it was cancelled over the disagreement.
Martin, orgininally backed the missile defence initiative and committed to closer co-operation with Washington when he came to office in 2004. This position was reversed last week

The green paper of the future of the BBC has asked for the Board of Governors to be scrapped and replaced by two boards, one representing the public and an executive board. The proposals were announced by the British Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell in the House of Commons. 
Other things she has asked for is the licence fee be kept, currently at GBP 121 (EUR 176.26) per householder, more independent television to be made on the BBC, currently 10% must be made by independent television companies &amp; to stop chasing ratings, mainly by copycating programmes from other channels. 
She said that the board of governors was “unsustainable” and lacked “clarity and accountability”. Shadow Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said that the green paper did “not go far enough” countining saying that they were “largely cosmetic changes to the structure and oversight of the BBC”. 
The green paper was made as the Charter that is the basis of the BBC is to reviewed in 2007 as required by law.

Blair rejects anti-terror bill compromise

A compromise put forward by the Conservatives that would have allowed easier passage through the Commons of the proposed new anti-terror legislation has been rejected by Prime Minister Tony Blair. The bill proposes new "control orders" for terror suspects which include house arrest, curfews, tagging and bans on internet and phone use. The bill will replace current powers that allow the detention of foreign terror suspects without trial which has been ruled against as a breach of human rights by the law lords.
The Conservatives wanted a "sunset clause" inserted into the bill which would have allowed ministers to revisit it in November. MPs from all parties have severely criticised the way the bill has been seemingly "steamrollered" through the Commons with only two days to debate the plans before a vote is called.
Conservative leader Michael Howard said in the Commons that it would be "far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through."
Mr. Blair said that the new house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. "I believe they are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk," he added.
Opposition to the bill by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have already won concessions this week. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has backed down and allowed judges to have the first say in the most severe control order cases, however, this may not be enough to ensure a smooth ride through the Lords. It is expected that the bill will face tough opposition and demands for a radical re-draft.
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has urged the Conservatives to "stick firm? There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months," he said.
A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said that it was a "basic principle" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. "Having a judge impose those punishments does not sanitise them either," she added.

Steve Fossett attempts a record flight around the world

Steve Fossett, piloting the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, has set the record of being the first person to fly around the world unrefueled, solo. He is also got the record for longest unrefueled flight of a jet aircraft.
Steve departed from Salina Kansas 18:47 CST on Monday and has successfully crossed the , Northern , the , and Southern and Central . He then crossed the Pacific moving from to , then went on to Southern . From there her crossed the Southwest United States, and landed back in Salina Kansas at 13:50 CST on Thursday. 
One major problem has been encountered during this trip. Somewhere in the first several hours of the flight 2600 pounds of fuel was lost. The engineers have two theories on what caused this loss. One is an extreme case of the fuel evaporation. It was expected to evaporate, but not at anything approaching this rate. The other possibility is that there was a leak or other type of error in the plumbing. Because the aircraft had never been flown fully fueled before, there was no previous data on what could be causing this.
Steve Fossett is already in the record books for being the first to pilot a balloon around the world. He has also been unsuccessfully attempting to achieve a record altitude for a glider for the last four years.
The aircraft was built for Sir Richard Branson and his Virgin Atlantic Airways. It was constructed by Burt Rutan. Burt also designed the Voyager airplane which was piloted by his brother Dick Rutan and Jenna Yeager on the first unrefueled flight around the world. Burt is also the designer of Space Ship One, the first private craft to enter space.

With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers. 
On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute.

Ex-Ontario Premier Harris to deny Ipperwash allegations

Ex-Ontario premier Mike Harris has allegedly made some comments that may link him to the violence that happened in a police action in 1995 which left a native activist killed.
Kettle Point chief Tom Bressette testified on Tuesday that he was warned just 12 hours before OPP officers marched on Ipperwash Provincial Park and killed native protestor Dudley George to "get those fucking Indians out of the park even if you have to draw your guns to do it". The warning was allegedly on the telephone by Bob Watts, a former employee of the Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat, on Sept. 6, 1995, just hours before OPP officers marched on Ipperwash Provincial Park.
Bressette claims that Watts told him Harris, who was premier of Ontario at the time, had made the comment in "some kind of cabinet meeting". Harris has always denied that he had nothing to do with the police action at the park. Peter Downard, his lawyer, says that his client will "absolutely" deny the allegations. and that his reputation has been tarnished with "very low-grade quality information that ordinarily would never have seen the light of day in a legal proceeding."
The inquiry is finding out how George was killed during a confrontation between Ontario Provincial Police officers and three dozen people protesting that ancestral burial grounds had been desecrated in Ipperwash Provincial Park. Acting Sgt. Kenneth Deane has already been convicted of criminal negligence causing George's death. The inquiry continues today.

Steven Fossett (60) landed safely back on soil earlier this evening to claim the world record for flying non-stop by himself around the world. He landed at 7.49 pm UTC in Kansas after what had been a nerve racking last few hours.
Having left with over 18,100 pounds of fuel on board the futuristic single seater "GlobalFlyer", it emerged that 2,600 pounds of fuel had "disappeared". This meant that had the winds gone against Fossett, he would have run out of fuel before the finish line. Luckily however, he was able to conserve fuel due to strong tail winds throughout the last few thousand miles of the journey.

Sunflower oil saves at-risk newborns from infection

Simply massaging low birth weight babies with sunflower seed oil can protect them from potentially fatal infections.
Infections and complications from preterm birth cause more than half of all neonatal deaths, and very low birth weight babies are particularly vulnerable. 
Preterm babies have immature skin that lacks a protective film called vernix that has antimicrobial properties. 
In some countries, such as India, newborns are routinely massaged with mustard oil. 
But mustard oil, says Gary Darmstadt of John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, can delay recovery of the skin barrier and have a toxic effect on skin. 
Seeking an alternative low-cost product, Darmstadt and colleagues experimented with sunflower oil and an ointment called Aquaphor that comprises petrolatum, mineral oil, mineral wax and lanolin.
The researchers tested the treatments on 497 newborns (72 hours old or less) and preterm babies (less than 33 weeks gestation) between 1998 and 2003 in Bangladesh.
They applied the treatments to the entire body besides the scalp and face three times daily for the first 14 days and then twice daily until discharge. 
Babies treated with sunflower oil were found 41% less likely to develop infections than controls.
"Evidence is emerging that the skin is much more important as a barrier to infection than previously recognized, particularly in preterm infants whose skin is underdeveloped," says Darmstadt. "The good news is that treatment is available to strengthen the function of the skin as a barrier in these vulnerable newborns."

Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena freed

Giuliana Sgrena was freed from captivity in Iraq today. The Italian journalist was abducted in Baghdad exactly a month ago while she had been reporting for Il Manifesto.
The Islamic Jihad Organisation had taken her hostage on the 4th February with the demand that Italy withdraw all of its troops from Iraq. On February 16, a video was released with a clearly distraught Mrs Sgrena begging for Italy to withdraw from Iraq. However despite the video, the Italian Senate voted to extend its miltary forces' stay in Iraq.
The reason for her release is unknown. Some Italian journalists have suggested that the Italian government paid a ransom.
Later on Friday, Sgrena's newspaper reported that U.S. forces fired at a car carrying the reporter shortly after her liberation, killing an Italian secret service agent. The editor of Il Manifesto newspaper, Gabriele Polo, was reported by Reuters as saying that Sgrena's car was fired on as it made its way to Baghdad airport. "This news which should have be a moment of celebration, has been ruined," Polo told Sky Italia television. 
"An Italian agent has been killed by an American bullet. A tragic demonstration which we never wanted that everything that's happening in Iraq is completely senseless and mad," he added.

Bill Gates, founder of the software giant Microsoft, has been made a "Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire" in recognition of his business skills and work on poverty reduction. He received the title on Wednesday, March 2, at a private meeting with Queen Elizabeth.
Now at age 48, Bill Gates is the world's wealthiest man, according to Forbes Magazine. Bill Gates rose to fame in the early nineties as the CEO of Microsoft, the maker of Microsoft Windows 95, the world's best selling computer operating system at the time.
Though Mr. Gates has now been knighted, he cannot use the term "Sir" since he is not a citizen of the United Kingdom. He can instead place the letters KBE after his name. If he chooses to become a subject of the Queen in the future, he can have his title upgraded to "Sir".

World-wide measles deaths drop 40% over last five years

The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nation's Children Fund (UNICEF) have released figures showing that world-wide, deaths from the disease measles have dropped by 40% over the last five years.
In 1999, 873,000 people died from disease, while that number fell to 530,000 in 2003 - a drop of 39%. The largest drop was seen in Africa - 46%.
Just ten years ago a million children a year died from the disease and another 30 million were affected, often being left with long-term disabilities such as brain damage and blindness.
WHO/UNICEF started a drive to cut measles deaths in 1999, with the aim of halving deaths by the end of 2005. Governments around the world began implementing their proposals.
The main aim was to achieve the vaccination of at least 90% of all children born (around 130 million a year). A second aim was to ensure that all children between nine months and 14 years old receive a second chance for immunization, either through routine health care or special initiatives. The special initiaves have proved especially effective, vaccinating 350 million children from 1999 to 2003.
An indirect benefit of the drop in measles cases has been the releasing of money previously used for measles treatment for other health care projects. For example, in Togo, 95% of children under five now receive vaccinations against measles and polio, mosquito nets to guard against malaria, and de-worming tablets.

Report finds Afghanistan is on the verge of becoming a narcotics state

March 5, 2005
A U.S. State Department report was released on Friday, March 4, officially detailing the extent to which production has soared in Afghanistan since the three years ago. The report made its way to U.S. Congress via Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Although the scope of study is large, investigating the status of illicit narcotics in almost every country during 2004, attention has focused on Afghanistan. With more than 510,000 sprawling acres of the impoverished country (three times the amount in 2003) utilized for Opium poppy cultivation (the raw material for ), the report warns that the country is becoming a "narcotics state" like Colombia for .
In addition, the report indicated that Afghanistan's opium production soared to 5,445 tons last year, producing 17 times more of the raw drug material than second-place Myanmar. The report stated that the explosion of narcotic production in Afghanistan is "an enormous threat to world stability."
To combat this issue, the Bush administration has proposed US$780 million to institute a plan that works on two levels: to promote alternative crops to farmers and to increase military interdiction for finding and destroying heroin labs and storage facilities. At the time of publishing, the U.S. government has already committed US$1.2 billion to for 2005.

Pope John Paul II dies

John Paul II (Karol Józef Wojtyła) 1920-2005
After months of failing health, "His Holiness" Pope John Paul II passed away today, April 2, at 9:37 p.m. local time (19:37 UTC). He was 84 years old. An email message to journalists from the spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls from The Vatican confirmed the death at 20:00 UTC.
The Pope had a earlier this year to help him breathe, and then lost his ability to speak last week. On Thursday March 31 he developed a urinary tract infection that led to septic shock and cardiovascular collapse. A nasogastric feeding tube was inserted to help him regain strength. The Pope elected not to return to Rome's Gemelli hospital, but instead to stay in his own apartments where he was tended to by his personal doctors and Vatican medical staff.
The same night, he was administered the "" also known as the last rites. On Friday April 1, the Vatican said he was having difficulties with both his heart and his kidneys.
 news agency Agenzia Giornalistica Italia reports the pope's final message was "I am happy, you be happy, too. Let's pray together with joy. I entrust everything to the Virgin Mary with joy".
A description of the last moment of the holy father from father Jarek Cielecki, director of the Vatican service news and of the Italian TV catolic Tele Padre Pio, tells us the last moment of life of this great man. "The Holy father died looking at the window, gathered in prayer. As such he was conscious. Just before dying, the Pope raised his right hand in a sign of blessing, as if he was aware of all the people gathered in prayer. Then, as soon as the prayer ended, the Pope did a huge effort, said the word 'Amen' and died."
The Vatican has announced that the funeral will take place on Wednesday, April 6 and that the Pope's body will lie in state from Monday, April 4.
Tributes.
Many have paid tribute to the Pope and his more than quarter-century reign:
Reaction around the world.
The announcement of Pope John Paul II's death in at 19:58 UTC was met with applause, a traditional Italian gesture of respect, followed by silence.
The Italian government declared three days of national mourning. (Earlier in the day, all major Italian sporting fixtures had already been cancelled.) It was reported that he had already been dubbed 'John Paul the Great' by many in the tearful crowd in St Peter's Square.
In , Poland, a crowd gathered in the square outside of the Archbishop's residence. The Polish government declared a period of national mourning, from today until the funeral.
Many Catholic churches around the world remained open to allow people to pray, or held special masses. In Dublin, Ireland, the remained open until midnight to allow people to pray privately for the deceased Pope. In the United Kingdom, Westmister Cathedral remained open to allow people to sign a book of condolence.
The flag of the United States flying over the White House was lowered to half mast.
Biography.
Born Karol Józef Wojtyła in , Poland on May 18, 1920, Pope John Paul II became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years when he was chosen on October 16, 1978 to lead the Roman Catholic Church following the sudden death of .
His more than 100 trips abroad have attracted enormous crowds (some of the largest ever assembled). With these trips, John Paul has covered a distance far greater than that traveled by all other popes combined. They have been seen as an outward sign of the efforts at global bridge-building between nations and between religions that have been central to his pontificate.
Pope John Paul II has beatified and canonized far more persons than any previous pope. It is reported that as of October 2004, he has beatified 1,340 people. Whether he has canonized more saints than all his predecessors put together, as is sometimes claimed, is difficult to prove, as the records of many early canonizations are incomplete or missing.
First diagnosed in 2001 and confirmed by the Vatican in 2003, the Pope had suffered from during the last few years of his life. This restricted him to only speaking a few sentences at a time and also affected his hearing and mobility.

US military developing non-lethal pain weapon

The US military is funding the research and development of a weapon that could be used to inflict excruciating pain from up to 2 kilometres away, but is meant to otherwise leave victims unharmed. Pain researchers have been left furious after work aimed at controlling pain has been used to develop technology aimed at maximising it.
Intended for use against protesters and rioters, the research focuses on the effect electromagnetic pulses can have on pain reception. Due to be ready by 2007, the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) weapon will fire a burst of electrically charged gas, or "plasma", which will generate an electromagnetic pulse on impact. It is this pulse which will trigger impulses in nerve cells causing extreme pain. 
A review of the non-lethal weapon by the US Naval Studies Board in 2003 concluded that PEPs produced “pain and temporary paralysis” in animal test subjects. Studies ongoing at the University of Central Florida in Orlando aim at optimising this effect. The ultimate aim is to generate a pulse which will trigger optimum pain in the subject without damaging tissues. Studies due to be carried out on lab grown cells aim at identifying the threshold of pain that can be inflicted on someone without causing death. There is some concern that the studies will fall short of demonstrating a safe level for a plasma burst. 
The work came to light after documents were released under the US's Freedom of Information Act to the Sunshine Project, an organisation who aims to expose biological weapons research. One document entitled “Sensory consequences of electromagnetic pulses emitted by laser induced plasmas” concerned the generation and firing of PEPs. Pain researchers have condemned the research, claiming that it could be put to use as a means of torture and that it is unethical. 
“I am deeply concerned about the ethical aspects of this research,” said Andrew Rice, a consultant in pain medicine at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. “Even if the use of temporary pain can be justified as a restraining measure, which I do not believe it can, the long-term physical and psychological effects are unknown.”
Clinical psychologist at University College London, Amanda Williams expressed concern that victims risk long term harm. “Persistent pain can result in a range supposedly non-destructive stimuli which nevertheless change the functioning of the nervous system,” she says. Studies “cannot tell us about the pain and psychological consequences of such painful experience,” she said.

Italian security officer Nicola Calipari has been killed, and Giuliana Sgrena as well as two other security agents have been wounded after U.S. forces opened fire on the car they were travelling in shortly after Sregna's release from captivity.
Multinational Force Iraq officials have stated that the car approached a military check-point at speed at 8:55pm Baghdad time on Friday. Soldiers opened fire on the vehicle, injuring Ms Sgrena and killing one other.
"There was suddenly this shooting, we were hit by a hail of gunfire, and I was speaking with Nicola, who was telling me about what had been happening in Italy in the meantime, when he leaned towards me, probably also to protect me. And then he collapsed and I realised that he was dead," Ms. Sgrena told Italy's RAI radio.
She said the shooting continued "because the driver wasn't even managing to explain that we were Italian."
When questioned if the car was going too fast as it approached the U.S. troops, she said: "We weren't going particularly fast given that type of situation." 
Ms Sgrena was given medical care by Coalition Forces medical personnel for a superficial wound to her shoulder. Her left-wing newspaper, Il Manifesto, claimed that the bullet had previously passed through the body of Calipari.
The Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, has demanded an explanation for the shooting. President Bush told Mr Berlusconi during a telephone call that there would be a full investigation, and offered his apologies.

Boeing had been suspended since July 24, 2003 after violating federal law. The company was discovered to have been in possession of thousands of pages of documentation from Lockheed Martin, Boeing's rival during the 1998 evolved expendable launch vehicle source selection process. 
The USAF and Boeing have signed an interim agreement to protect the Air Force's interests. The agreement allows for the reinstating of the suspension if Boeing is indicted or convicted, or if new evidence is found. 
Boeing will have to submit to outside verification of the remedial steps it has taken, and cannot charge the Air Force for associated costs. Internal management responsibilities for ethical practice have been changed.

The law shows the "strong determination of the Chinese people" and will "never allow secessionist forces working for 'Taiwan independence' to succeed at breaking away from the mainland" according to an announcement made by China's Premier Wen Jiabao at the National People's Congress in Beijing.
The Chinese State Council is also planning to increase the country's military budget by 12.6 percent, to US$29.98 billion, for the current fiscal year.

US and France ask Syria to leave Lebanon

The US and France are repeating their calls for Syria to completely withdraw from Lebanon. The two countries are leading an international campaign, based upon the UN Security Council Resolution 1559.
Syria's president Bashar al-Assad promised to gradually withdraw his troops from the region, but the US State Department is calling Bashar al-Assad's promise "insufficient" and demanded an "immediate and full withdrawal".
The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement which read, "We note the announcement by the president of the Syrian republic of his decision to apply" UN Resolution 1559. "We, therefore, expect him to fully withdraw his troops and services from Lebanon as soon as possible."
Bashar al-Assad has announced a "two-phase" withdrawal of Syria's troops, but the timetable is not yet determined.
"The Syrian army wants to pull out quickly ... as soon as possible logistically," said Syrian cabinet minister Buthaina Shaaban.
Other countries shared the concerns of the US and France:
Lebanese opposition leader Walid Jumblatt welcomed Bashar al-Assad's announcement, calling it a "positive start", but other leaders, such as former President Amin Gemayel are concerned that "the Syrian army will stay in the mountain range within the Lebanese border".
The international campaign to ask Syria to withdraw from Lebanon has gained increased publicity since the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, in Beirut, on February 14.

Freed hostage Sgrena, says shooting &quot;no accident&quot;

Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena has suggested that it was "no accident" when US troops shot at her car, resulting in the death of an Italian intelligence officer who had helped to secure her release from captivity earlier that day.
Speaking to the press at the Rome hospital where she is being treated for a gunshot wound to her shoulder, she said, "It can't be just said that it was just an accident. We can't accept this, it is not possible."
Sgrena's suggestion is being reinforced by her partner, Pier Scolari who said "I hope the Italian government does something because either this was an ambush, as I think, or we are dealing with imbeciles or terrorized kids who shoot at anyone," 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at a press conference in Rome today looked visibly angry and said "I immediately invited the American ambassador to come speak with me, to clarify the actions of the American military for such a grave accident that someone is going to have to take responsibility for,"
Sgrena claims that Italian secret service agent Nicola Calipari was fatally hit when he moved in front of her in the car after the soldiers opened fire on the group.
"It wasn't a checkpoint, but a patrol that started shooting after pointing some lights in our direction," the Ansa news agency cited Sgrena as telling prosecutors. "We hadn't previously encountered any checkpoint, and we didn't understand where the shots came from." The New York Times quotes Sgrena as stating that, "There was no bright light, no signal."
The London Observer reported, "Sgrena told colleagues the vehicle was not travelling fast and had already passed several checkpoints on its way to the airport. The Americans shone a flashlight at the car and then fired between 300 and 400 bullets at if from an armoured vehicle. Rather than calling immediately for assistance for the wounded Italians, the soldiers' first move was to confiscate their weapons and mobile phones and they were prevented from resuming contact with Rome for more than an hour."
The US military said in a statement: "About 2100 [1800 GMT], a patrol in western Baghdad observed the vehicle speeding towards their checkpoint and attempted to warn the driver to stop by hand and arm signals, flashing white lights, and firing warning shots in front of the car. When the driver didn't stop, the soldiers shot into the engine block, which stopped the vehicle, killing one and wounding two others." 
American soldiers have had been victims of suicide car-bomb attacks in the past. On December 4, 2004, two cars exploded next to a checkpoint at the Green Zone in Baghdad, killing 16 and wounding dozens. On December 13, another car exploded in Baghdad killing 13.
Sgrena had been held captive for a month by Iraqi rebels. She works for the Italian newspaper Il Manifesto, founded by the former leader of Communist Youth Luciana Castellina . The paper has been characterized by the Partito della Rifondazione Comunista as a "communist daily" that has been "engaged against the war [in Iraq]."

CIA sending suspects overseas for &quot;rendition&quot;

The CIA has been secretly authorized by a classified directive, signed by US President Bush, to send suspects overseas as part of a "rendition" process.
The program has been used to manage the large case load which has accumulated since the September 11, 2001 attacks, leaving US officials free to concentrate on the "high value" suspects who are kept under US control at secret locations throughout the world.
Today, US officials were reluctant to defend this policy for any specific cases, but White House spokesman Dan Bartlett presented a generic defense of US anti-terrorism policies on Sunday talk shows in the United States.
A former government official claimed that the program was "fully authorized" and that the CIA was "not doing anything illegal" in an interview with The New York Times, and said that the leadership of the House and Senate intelligence committees was able to find out about the program, or had been informed of its existence.
Allowing the CIA to have so much power in deciding who can stay in the country and who is shipped off to other countries is controversial, because in the past, the White House, State Department, or Justice Department would have been involved in approving individual cases of sending prisoners to other countries.
While refusing to admit that the rendition policy even exists, the Bush administration claimed that they do not hand over people to be tortured in other countries, to get around US laws which prohibit such practices.
However, the New York Times interviewed a number of current and former officials who believed that the policy was designed to allow the government to plausibly deny that torture was being tolerated.
The case of Australian Mamdouh Habib attracted widespread attention in that country, after he was released in January after 40 months, without any charges being pressed. Australian officials were aware that he had been transferred by the United States to Egypt for six months. During this time, Habib claims he was subjected to various methods of torture, including electric shock and being held under water.
The United States denies that Habib was tortured with their knowledge, although US officials were not present during his overseas captivity and could not guarantee that he had not been tortured. Egypt has not confirmed that Habib was ever in the country.
A similar case involving Syrian born Canadian Maher Arar, deported to Syria in October, 2002, subsequently held and allegedly tortured for 374 days, led to Canada issuing a travel advisory strongly cautioning Canadians born in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and Sudan against travel to the United States for any reason. A subsequent internal RCMP investigation found several instances of impropriety in the Arar case, including the provision of sensitive information on Arar to US officials, and that a liaison officer may have known of the deportation plan but did not contact his supervisors.
Mr. Arar's attempt to sue American Attorney-General John Ashcroft over the incident in January 2004 was dismissed when the US government invoked the rarely used "state secrets privilege", claiming that to go forward in open court would jeopardize intelligence, foreign policy, and national security interests.
Legal analysts point out that information obtained through the use of torture is useless in court proceedings, but US officials insist that the information obtained from such interrogations is still useful for their purposes, and that "it has resulted in the capture of terrorists."

Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe passes away at age of 98

Nobel Laureate in Physics died in his home in on March 6, 2005, according to Cornell University, where he was professor emeritus of physics. 
Hans Albrecht Bethe (pronounced "Bay-ta") was born on July 2, 1906 in the city of , then part of Germany (now part of France). He studied physics at Frankfurt and obtained his doctorate from the . 
Bethe, whose mother was [[Judaism|Jewish}}, fled Germany in 1933 when the came to power. Bethe, along with hundreds of other Jewish academics, were fired from their posts as a result of one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s first anti-Semitic acts. Bethe moved first to [[England]] and in 1935 to the [[USA]] where he taught at Cornell University. 
Between 1935 and 1938, he studied and reaction cross sections. This research was useful to Bethe in more quantitatively developing 's theory of the compound nucleus.
During [[World War II]], he served as a prominent member of a special summer session at the at the invitation of , which outlined the first designs for the and served as the beginning of the . When Oppenheimer started the secret weapons design laboratory, , he appointed Bethe as Director of the Theoretical Division. 
After the war, Bethe argued that a crash project for the should not be attempted, though after announced the beginning of such a crash project, and the outbreak of the , he signed up and played a key role in the weapon's development. In 1968, he reflected upon the choice, noting that "It seemed quite logical. But sometimes I wish I were more consistent an idealist." Though he would see the project through to its end, in Bethe's account he was primarily hopeful that the weapon would be impossible to produce. He later characterized as the "father" of the hydrogen bomb, and as its "mother," and himself as its "midwife." 
Among his many honors, Bethe received the in 1955, and in 1961 he was awarded the of the for his work in identifying the energy generating processes in stars. In 1967, Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his studies of the production of solar and stellar energy, . He postulated that the source of this energy are in which was converted into .
During the 1980s and 1990s, Bethe campaigned for the peaceful use of [[nuclear energy]], arguing against the and against . In 1995, at the age of 88, Bethe wrote an open letter calling on all scientists to "cease and desist" from working on any aspect of nuclear weapons development and manufacture. In 2004, he signed a letter along with 47 other Nobel laureates endorsing [[John Kerry]] for president of the United States citing [[George W. Bush|Bush]]'s apparent misuse of science.

Insulin levels tied to Alzheimer's

 production has been discovered in the brain and linked to , potentially changing how the illness is viewed and treated.
While , a characteristic of , is linked with neurodegeneration, the new finding provides a strong connection between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
"What we found is that insulin is not just produced in the pancreas, but also in the brain," says study senior author Suzanne de la Monte of and Brown University . "And we discovered that insulin and its growth factors, which are necessary for the survival of brain cells, contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's." 
This raises the possibility, says de la Monte, of a "type 3" diabetes. 
The finding was made by studying a genetic abnormality in rats that blocks insulin signaling in the brain.
In the rats, de la Monte and colleagues found that insulin and related proteins IGF I and II are expressed in neurons in several regions in the brain. 
Additionally, they determined that a drop in insulin production in the brain contributes to brain cell degeneration, a symptom of Alzheimer's. 
"These abnormalities do not correspond to type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but reflect a different and more complex disease process that originates in the CNS (central nervous system)," the researchers report. 
Analysis of postmortem brain tissue also revealed that the proteins aren't produced at normal levels in human Alzheimer's sufferers. 
Insulin and IGF I were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus—all areas affected by Alzheimer's—while not in the cerebellum, which is generally not affected by Alzheimer's. 
The study "opens the way for targeted treatment to the brain and changes the way we view Alzheimer's disease," says de la Monte.

British Airways CEO set to step down in the summer

The Sunday Times and Observer newspapers today both stated that British Airways CEO Rod Eddington is planning to step down in the Summer. Althought no official announcement has been released from the airline about Mr Eddington's future, speculation is already mounting on who the successor will be.
Possible internal candidates include marketing director Martin George and finance director John Rishton. However it is quite possible that an external executive such as Willie Walsh, former CEO of Aer Lingus, could take the post. Mr Walsh successful turned around Aer Lingus into one of the most profitable "national carriers" in the world after it had almost bankrupt in 2002.

Peruvians sue Newmont Mining Company over mercury poisoning

Peruvians living near the site of a release of mercury are preparing to sue a U.S. mining company, announcing last Saturday that they will bring their case before a Denver judge.
On June 2, 2000, a serious accident in the province of Cajamarca, in Peru, poisoned many residents with mercury, a highly toxic heavy metal. A truck from Newmont Mining Company dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an Andean highway, in the communities of San Juan, Choropampa, and Magdalena. Curious townspeople (mostly children) picked up the silvery droplets, and some even drank some of it. Many residents became sick from severe mercury poisoning. Some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered blindness, and one even had a purplish rash on her body.
Over 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning.
As the owners of the Yanacocha mine which produced the mercury, Newmont Mining offered up to US$6 thousand to more than 700 local residents, but over 1,100 others are still engaged in a legal battle with Newmont over the case.
In today's global economy, many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits, but environmental law professor James Otto is asking about the cost to the environment and public health. "Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a 'social license' to operate," he said. "Peru has been a wake-up call."
As the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against Denver-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold mining firm, some of these important questions may finally be answered. After the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on January 20, the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public. Last Saturday, March 5, 2005, they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge Robert Hyatt. "If successful," states Ken Krowder who represents the plaintiffs, "[this] would mark the first time an American firm is held accountable for environmental damages overseas."
This is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging Third World environmental movement. Recently, in August 2004, a US$543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the Indonesian Environmental Ministry and local villagers. They claim that pollution caused by the company’s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems, including skin disease, tumors, birth defects, and a decline in fish stocks, a staple food. One particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal, a waste disposal method for mercury and arsenic that is outlawed in the United States.
At least six Newmont Mining managers, including an American and an Australian, face up to 15 years in a Jakarta prison for environmental and corporate crime in that case.
The local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries. Thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall, demanding protection for the local water supply.
Newmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor, and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system.

The President of Bolivia officially resigned Sunday, March 6. Now the President of Senate Hormando Vaca Díez is the temporary President of the Republic of Bolivia. 
Mesa resigned because of the announcement of highways's blockages by , both the leader of the growers and the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). The blockages serve to pressure the Legislative so the Hydrocarbons Law can be approved. The law aims to raise the taxes levied on hydrocarbon extraction from 18 to 50%.
The MAS is a political party formed basically by coca-growing (known as "cocaleros"), , admirers of , and people. The party is against the government of the and the alleged American influency in the region, the and the . Morales in his own words, explain some of the MAS motivations:
Morales is an admirer of Fidel Castro and he says he is inspired by the presidents of and , . He supports the creation of an anti-imperialist block formed by Latin-American and Arabian countries against the USA, which is being organized by the Brazilian President.
Bolivia economy depends on exportation of (oil and gas). Other sources of resources comes from the cultivation of coca.
The coca growers demands the same treatment the government is giving to hydrocarbons. However, the production of coca in great quantities is controversial since the coca is the raw material of . Cocaine is considered illegal in Bolivia and in the majority of other countries
In October 2003, Morales caused the resignation of the President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada. After the resignation of Lozada, Mesa, the vice-president, assumed the command of Bolivan government.
Morales said about the resignation of Mesa:"The only resignation purpose is to blackmail, this resignation is not worth, it basically serves so the October agenda does not occurr (agenda purpose is nationalization of gas production and to proclaim a Constitutional Assembly [Note:where politics propose a new Constitution]). 
The blockades of roads occurred in two strategical places: at the city of El Alto, neighboring to the capital, and at El Chapere, which binds the cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. 
The country is divided. There were some protests and manifestations for and against Mesa.

Invisibility shield gets blueprint

Two engineers, Andrea Alù and Nader Engheta of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have come up with a 'plasmonic cover' which they claim could render objects "nearly invisible to an observer".
The idea is still in its infancy, but it is said not to violate any obvious laws of physics. John Pendry, a physicist at Imperial College in London, UK: "The concept is an interesting one, with several important potential applications. It could find uses in stealth technology and camouflage."
Earlier attempts at constructing an invisibility screen resulted in the chameleon-principle: screens were coloured to match their background, rendering them hard, but not impossible to see, but usually from only a limited point of view.
The principle on which the technology is founded can be explained as follows: an object can be seen because light scatters from its surface back to our eyes. If the scattering of light could be prevented, the object could not be seen. By making a screen resonate in tune with the light, scattering of light would be prevented. This can be achieved by using plasmons, waves of electronic density caused by electrons in a metalic surface moving in sync. If the frequency of the light is close to that of the shield, the light scattered by the object will be negligible compared to the light scattered by the shield. For visible light, silver and gold can be used as metals, for other frequencies, such as infrared and ultra-violet, other metals will have to be used.

China declares &quot;the state shall employ nonpeaceful means&quot;

China passed a new law that codifies a legal basis for authorising the use of military force to stop Taiwan from formally declaring its independence from the mainland. The anti-succession law was passed by the National People's Congress on March 8 in Beijing.
The deputy chairman of the NPC told members gathered at the Great Hall of the People that, "If possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity." The broad language of the law does not specify any exact measures China might take, but its effect is to reinforce the mainland's long held position of a one-China principle.
The Mainland Affairs Council in Taipei described the law as "malicious" and "crude". Taiwan views the development as violating international norms for peacefully resolving disputes. "This law exposes China's plot to impose armed force to swallow up Taiwan," read the council's written statement. "In essence, it has handed its military a blank check to unleash force against Taiwan." A Taiwanese Defence Ministry spokesperson announced that military exercises will be held this summer to practice defending against an attack.
The White House had urged China to reconsider the law before it was passed. White House press secretary Scott McClellan said, "We view it as unhelpful - something that runs counter to recent trends toward a warming in cross-strait relations. We oppose any attempts to determine the future of Taiwan by anything other than peaceful means."
China has always officially maintained that Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949, is a rogue territory which must eventually reunify with China. Just recently in a ‘four point guideline' set forth on March 5, 2005, Chinese President Hu Jintao said, "On no account shall the 1.3 billion Chinese people allow anyone to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will not have the slightest hesitation, falter or concession on the major principle issue of opposing secession. The 'Taiwan independence' secessionist forces must abandon their secessionist stand and stop all 'Taiwan independence' activities."
Chinese opposition to a plan by Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian for a referendum on a new constitution that may violate Jintao's ‘four-point guideline' is seen in part as prompting the new law.

Premature aging disease reversed in cells

Genetic abnormalities behind the premature aging disease Progeria have been corrected in cells in a step towards gene therapy for the condition.
Affecting about one in eight million children, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria (HGP) causes sufferers to rapidly experience symptoms of old age. 
The average life expectancy of those afflicted is just around 14 years, with many dying from such age-related conditions as heart disease. 
The disease is known to be caused by a mutation in the gene lamin A. 
The mutation is thought to adversely affect the expression of genes by preventing appropriate genetic "editing." 
The inappropriate editing cuts exons—"sentences" of genetic information—too short.
Tom Misteli and colleagues of the US National Cancer Institute have now found a way to correct the editing error.
They did this using synthetic molecules called morpholino oligonucleotides that Misteli likens to a "molecular Band-Aid."
The researchers say the discovery could aid the development of gene therapy for Progeria.
The research is reported in the journal "Nature Medicine."

Syria begins withdrawing troops from Lebanon

&lt;br&gt;
Syria has begun to withdraw its troops from northern and southern Lebanon despite a large rally in Beirut to support the Syrian presence.
Lebanese Defence Minister Abdul-Rahim Murad said troops would pull back to the eastern Bekaa Valley on Tuesday, but refused to give a date for a full withdrawal. The movement of the 6,000 troops involved would take six to ten days, he said. Syria has a total of 14,000 soldiers in the country.
Earlier, a peaceful Hezbollah-organised rally saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets of Beirut to show their support for the Syrians. The pro-Syrian Lebanon-based Shia Muslim organization, which maintains an armed militia in Lebanon, promised more rallies throughout Lebanon. According to Michel Aoun, a former Prime Minister of Lebanon, it appears that the turnout was artificially inflated, with Palestinian, Syrian, and other non-Lebanese groups attending, as well as with coercive tactics used by Syrian intelligence officials.
Lebanese opposing the presence of Syrian troops held counter-rallies just 300m away, with smaller turn-outs.
Syria has come under increasing political pressure to withdraw. U.S. President George W. Bush said in a speech today, "Freedom will prevail in Lebanon. All Syrian military forces and intelligence personnel must withdraw before the Lebanese elections for those elections to be free and fair." 
Lebanon plans to hold a general election in May.
Syrian troops and intelligence officers have been present in Lebanon since the country began a peace-keeping mission in Lebanon during the 1976, following the start of Lebanon's civil war. U.S. forces withdrew in 1984 after a suicide attack killed 241 Marines. Ever since, Syria has had a strong political hold on its neighbour.
United Nations Resolution 1559 requires the immediate and complete withdrawal of all Syrian forces from Lebanon. France, Russia, Germany, and Saudi Arabia have made similar calls.

Ash and steam reported over Mount St. Helens

Portland, Oregon – A cloud of white steam and ash rose as high as 36,000 feet from Mount St. Helens in the U.S. state of Washington at 5:27 p.m. PST today. The eruption was visible from the Portland metropolitan area in the neighbouring state of Oregon, causing traffic slowdowns as commuters slowed to watch the spectacle. News helicopters have shown photos of lava emerging inside the crater. Although the eruption was mostly over by 6:07 p.m. PST, an ashfall advisory until 9:00 p.m. PST has been announced for communities around the mountain. 
The volcano has been building a new dome in its crater in recent months and causing tremors. It seems to have done enough damage to knock out at least two of the seismometers operated on its dome by the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network, although this could be the result of either damage to the seismometers themselves, or their telemetry equipment.
The volcano is most famous for its dramatic eruption in 1980 which killed 57 people and blew the top off the mountain.

The Brazilian physicist Cesare Mansueto Giulio Lattes, aged 80, known as Cesar Lattes died on March 8, 2005 at 3:40 pm. His death was caused by a cardio-respiratory failure and occurred at the Hospital of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), in the Barão Geraldo district, in the city of Campinas, São Paulo state, Brazil.
Lattes, along with Giuseppe Occhialini and Cecil Powell was responsible for the discovery of the subatomic particle called the pion, in 1947. This discovery was very important for the understanding of the sub-atomic structure of the atom.

Children poisoned by tainted cassava in the Philippines

Over 27 children are dead, and another 100 are hospitalized, after eating tainted cassava on the central Philippine island of Bohol, according to local officials. Francisca Doliente told The Associated Press that a friend who shared a portion of the cassava with her 9-year-old niece, Arve Tamor, was "gone...She died".
"It was during recess time. The children bought cassava," said Mabini Vice-Mayor Ester Tabigue.
"Several children were brought here vomiting and complaining of stomach aches," said Dr. Elpidio Bonito. He noted that seven children did not make it to the hospital before succumbing to the food poisoning.
At the Ubay L.G. Cotamura Community Hospital, Dr. Leta Cutamora confirmed 14 fatalities and 35 others under treatment.
Almost 50 students from the San Jose Elementary School were sent to two other hospitals. One of the sellers of the cassava, a middle-aged woman, was also sent to the hospital.
Cassava is a starchy delicacy made from a tropical plant. It is poisonous when raw, and must be prepared properly so it is not converted into cyanide by the human digestive system.
"Some said they took only two bites because it tasted bitter and the effects were felt five to 10 minutes later," said Dr. Harold Garcia, from the Garcia Memorial Provincial Hospital.
A sample of the cassava will be studied at local Crime Laboratory Group, to try and determine what caused the food poisoning. The cassava was deep-fried and caramelized.

Trial of alleged Brazilian &quot;chainsaw massacre&quot; deputy begins

The trial of the former Brazilian deputy Hildebrando Pascoal was scheduled to began on March 8 at 8:30 AM in Brasília. However the trial began about an hour later, because Pascoal needed to talk to his lawyer.
Pascoal, the former police officer Reginaldo Rocha de Souza and the alleged drug dealer Alexandre Alves da Silva are in trial because they are accused of murdering the police officer Walter Ayala in September 1997.
There are several other serious accusations against Pascoal, including: dealing with the drug cartel, leading death squads, robbery and political corruption. 
The case was widely discussed in Brazil because a witness (whose identity could not be revealed since its life was in danger) said that Pascoal personally cut off the arms and legs of a man with a chainsaw. Another one told Pascoal killed at least 60 people.
Pascoal says he is innocent and that all the accusations were forged by his enemies: the former Court President of Acre, Jersino José da Silva and the Federal Prosecutor, Luiz Francisco de Souza.
Pascoal has been in jail for about 6 years.

<doc id="5525" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=5525" title="Report urges Kenya to ban plastic bags">
Report urges Kenya to ban plastic bags

They are cheap, useful, and very plentiful, and that is exactly the problem, according to researchers. A report issued on Feb. 23 by a cadre of environment and economics researchers suggested that Kenya should ban the common plastic bag that one gets at the checkout counter of grocery stores, and place a levy on other plastic bags, all to combat the country's environmental problems stemming from the bags' popularity.
The trouble with bags.
The new report was a result of work by Kenyan government, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. It evaluated the state of waste management in the country with particular attention to plastic bag pollution, and recommended that bags less than 30 microns in thickness be banned, a levy be placed on suppliers of thicker bags, and a number of programs be developed to encourage people in the country to not litter, but to recycle and use alternative or reusable bags for their shopping needs instead.
On one hand, the bags are often better than the alternatives, and are getting better. The Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) in the United States quotes the University of Arizona 's report that plastics are getting more compact and take up less space in landfills. Plastic bags compare favorably with paper bags which require more energy to produce, generate more waste and burn less cleanly, according to the SPI.
But on the other hand, the bags have gotten so thin as to be barely reusable and recyclable: grocers will frequently double-bag heavy produce, and the bag weighs so little that a great number of bags have to be collected to create an effectively recycled mass of plastic. The light-weight bags are easily picked up by wind, and end up escaping open trash bins and refuse heaps. By littering the landscape, plastic bags become a choking hazard for cattle; in the sea they hurt marine mammals. In , plastic bags were banned after they were blamed for blocking storm drains and causing flooding. Even if they do enter the landfill successfully, the bags take up to 1000 years to bio-degrade.
Plastic bags in Kenya are an especially acute problem. According to the report, waste management in the country isn't very effective, due partially to a lack of municipal trash pickup in squatter settlements and satellite towns outside the cities' boundaries. Less than 25% of the solid waste generated daily gets processed by a combination of public and private efforts. 
Sometimes plastic bag litter can have even further consequences. According to 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kenyan Professor Wangari Mathaai, discarded bags fill up with rainwater and become perfect breeding grounds for malaria-bearing mosquitoes. is Africa's most deadly infectious disease in children, and over 50% of all hospital visits in some areas are malaria-related. Social costs of plastic litter add up as well: countries lacking comprehensive waste management often sprout underground economies of ragpickers — typically children who wander refuse heaps and collect potentially recyclable materials for sale to shady businessmen operating from official dump sites. The ragpickers in developing countries struggle with plastic bags, preferring thicker materials that require fewer items to be picked up for the same weight.
The problem with bags is that they are victims of their own success: they are so very cheap to manufacture that, at a cost of 0.01 per bag, retailers often absorb the price of bags into the price of merchandise they sell. This makes the bag appear free to the consumers, who in turn do not value it, and toss the bag away with little reuse. In a vicious circle, the low cost of the bags drives down the amount of material used to manufacture them, creating bags that are flimsy and not easy to reuse.
The report places an emphasis on learning from the successes and failures of other countries' approaches to regulating the plastics industry. Several European countries introduced legislation that deals with plastic bags. In Ireland, a surcharge on plastic bags decreased their use by 90%. A similar move in Denmark saw the bag use drop by 66%. Australia and New Zealand have also considered or implemented some plastics regulation legislation. South Africa's plastic bag problem reached a climax in 2003 — plastic bags littered the street to such an extent that they earned the nickname "national flower". The country introduced regulations similar to those proposed in Kenya, and within less than a year a reduction in plastic litter was already apparent, according to the report.
The report also recognizes that policies require tradeoffs, and incorporates this into their recommendations. For example, the suggested policy of banning thin bags in favor of thicker ones seems counterintuitive: after all, the thicker ones contain more material that is the cause of the pollution. Furthermore, a ban on thin bags will decimate the industry producing those bags, likely resulting in job losses for Kenyans, as was the case in South Africa when that country introduced similar legislation. However the report notes that this will be offset by increases in production of alternative bags, or in the recycling industry.
Making plastics.
The manufacture of plastic bags is a sizable industry. In the United States alone the film, sheet, and bag portion of the plastics industry produces more than $26 billion in sales in one year. The sheer number of plastic bags used are staggering, too: in Hong Kong more than a quarter of a billion bags get used every year, in San Francisco over 50 million, and almost 300 million in Kenya. The SPI — the parent organization of the Film and Bag Federation — claims that more than 80% of consumers reuse plastic bags as trash can liners or for similar purposes, but that's misleading even when restricted to the United States, as the number of bags used is still very high on a per-capita basis. According to the Worldwatch Institute, an independent environmental organization, Americans throw away 100 billion plastic bags every year, with only 0.6% of the bags being recycled.
The bag manufacturer association in the — the Film and Bag Federation — appears aware of environmental issues surrounding their products. The Federation's web site explores some environmental concerns, mainly recycling and reuse. But the issue of plastic bag overuse or excessive littering in developing countries is not addressed directly on their site.
Donna Dempsey, the Executive Director of the Film and Bag Federation, said in an email to a Wikinews reporter that "there are better ways in Kenya and other places to reduce the amount of bags used, such as re-educating the grocery bag checker not to double bag products and on the amount of groceries one bag is made to carry". She said that members of the association — companies in the United States and — are investing millions of dollars into "bag to bag" recycling programs, which use material from recycled plastic bags to create new plastic bags, as well as programs that buy back recycled bags and turn them into plastic decking.
Support and opposition.
The government of Kenya has signaled that they support solutions to problems caused by plastic waste. At the opening speech of the UNEP Governing Council/Ministerial Environment Forum on Feb. 21, 2005, Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki said: "In our major cities, plastic bags are used in large quantities at the household level. However, these bags are not disposed of in ways that ensure a clean environment. My country welcomes initiatives to address this problem." 
Prof. Wangari Maathai, who is the country's deputy environment minister, supports the effort from her official position. She promotes the 4-Rs — Reduce, Recycle, Re-use, Repair — and encourages the use of locally-made cotton or sisal bags. Yet as the authors of the report write policy action must be fairly swift to be effective, so should the government commit to the report authors' recommendations it will have to quickly match political action with their words of support.
Plastic bag pollution has been a contentious issue with the people of Kenya for a number of years. Six years ago, the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya organized a campaign march to urge the government to regulate the bag producers. But not everyone is optimistic about the plans to regulate plastic bags. Dave Jones from believes that the way to control pollution is to have clear policies on land ownership: "No single land owner would allow his property to be polluted by others" he writes in a letter to Kenya's daily newspaper, the Daily Nation. In after the bag regulations were implemented negative reactions included concerns that the poor already re-used the flimsy bags as source materials in producing home-made items such as hats or purses — occupations made impossible by the ban.

Son of slain Chechen rebel Maskhadov vows to continue father's work

After the recent killing of Chechen rebel leader , it was not clear who would take his place. His son Anzor Maskhadov, aged 29, has quickly emerged as the most likely candidate to carry on his father's work.
Speaking at his home in , Azerbaijan, Mr. Maskhadov told the Reuters news agency "I will continue my father's work. I have been in touch with his associates who are living abroad." He went on to describe the killing of his father as a "terrorist act" planned by the Russian authorities.
The Chechnya area of Russia has effectively been at war with Russia for much of the past decade: pro-independence guerrilla groups are faced by Russian regular army and special police forces. Numerous crimes against civilians and human rights infringement incidents reported in the area, involving both Russian army and rebel groups. 
Late President Maskhadov was considered a moderate pro-independence Chechen leader, in contrast with . He made numerous negotiations offers, all of them left unanswered by the . With Russian forces nominally controlling most of the Chechnya, his ability to control Chechen warlords was being questioned, though he reportedly managed to maintain lateral cease-fire in most parts of Chechnya shortly before his death. 
Maskhadov was the last publicly elected leader of the self-proclaimed Republic of Ichkeria. It's first elected president, was killed in the sophisticated special forces operation of Russia's FSB in the 1990s.
Russian state run-media and MPs hailed the killing of Mr. Maskhadov — many believing his rebels were responsible for the and the in 2004.
Russian government took the hard-line position against Chechen rebels, denying any negotiations with the rebels after hostage takings and bomb explosions in Moscow (), downed airliners, hostage taking in and other terrorist acts attributed to Chechen rebel groups. In many cases, Chechen groups claimed responsibility for these acts. Maskhadov denied any involvement in terrorist acts. According to Russian government's point of view, the war in Chechnya is merely a 'counter-terrorist operation' with an objective to 'restore the constitutional order'.

Ancient neanderthal protein sequenced

An international team has extracted and sequenced a protein from a 75,000-year-old Neanderthal fossil in research that demonstrates a new method of comparing genetic relationships between organisms.
"This research opens up the possibility of getting detailed protein information from past human populations, to make inferences about the evolution of human diet and physiology," says Erik Trinkaus of Washington University in St. Louis.
The research was led by Trinkaus and colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. 
The oldest fossil human protein ever sequenced, the protein came from a Neanderthal discovered in Shanidar Cave, Iraq.
Protein sequences can be used in a similar way to DNA to provide information on genetic relationships between extinct and living species. 
Since ancient DNA rarely survives, protein sequencing could be used to determine such relationships for very old fossils that no longer contain DNA. 
For their study, Trinkaus and colleagues sequenced the bone protein osteocalcin from a Neanderthal and found that it is the same as that in modern humans. 
The researchers also found big differences in the sequences of Neanderthals, humans, chimpanzees and orangutans from that of gorillas and most other mammals. 
They suggest that this is a dietary response related to an abundance of vitamin C in the diets of herbivores such as gorillas that is absent from the diets of omnivorous primates such as humans and Neanderthals. 
The research is reported in the "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences".

Italian PM rejects US version of shooting

In his first public speech since the fatal shooting that killed an Italian Intelligence agent in Iraq, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has rejected the version of events presented by the US administration. 
The intelligence agent, Nicola Calipari, was escorting freed hostage, Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena, when their car came under fire by US troops on the journey to Baghdad airport last week, leaving Nicola Calipari dead and Giuliana Sgrena and another intelligence agent wounded. 
Mr Berlusconi has disputed US claims that the car was speeding and also said that the US military had known of and authorised the car's journey. Berlusconi's speech to parliament comes a day after his Foreign Minister, Gianfranco Fini made a similar speech to lawmakers, where he refuted Ms. Sgrena's claims that the shooting was the result of an ambush. 
The US began their official investigation on March 8, four days after the shooting. The results are yet to be determined.
However in a statement given immediately after the attack by the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division, who controls Baghdad, said that Italian officials had given no advance warning to the US Army of their journey, and that the car was speeding and refused to stop. One Army official stated that the car was traveling over 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour) and almost hydroplaned several times, an assertion that Sgrena herself seemingly corroborated in her article for "Il Manifesto".
"The United States has no intention of evading the truth. I'm sure that in a very short time every aspect of this will be clarified." Mr Berlusconi said, describing the shooting as an "accident." Adding that he expected the findings of an investigation into the shooting, being led by a US brigadier general, in cooperation with Italian authorities, to be released in three to four weeks.
Meanwhile the office of Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said that it had received a letter from U.S. President George Bush saying that the shooting was a "terrible tragedy" and that "President Bush assures President Ciampi that the United States will move toward a swift and exhaustive joint investigation."
Recently, the Associated Press and the Italian RAI TGI television released photos of the car after the attack by American soldiers., The pictures show little visible damage to the vehicle. 
Sgrena claims that the American soldiers fired between 300 and 400 rounds at the car from an armoured vehicle. This is disputed by the US military, as a tank or other fighting vehicle would likely have entirely destroyed the car.

Bush calls Romania a special ally of the US

President Traian Băsescu of Romania today had a half-hour meeting with President George Bush in the White House, as well as a press conference in the Oval Office, as part of Băsescu's visit to the United States of America. During the press conference, Bush said that Romania was a "special ally" of the United States, as well as "a friend". 
Bush said that he was impressed by Băsescu's high-profile fight against corruption, as well as his vision for consolidating democracy and prosperity in the Black Sea region, an area of strategic concern for the United States. He also acknowledged Romania's support and involvement in the democratisation project in Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova.
Since the 1999 NATO military intervention in Kosovo, Romania has been a key ally for the United States in Southeastern Europe. It has also been one of the most vocal supporters of the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending over 800 troops and planning to increase its contigent at a time when other countries are pulling out. Băsescu, which has been Romania's president since December 2004, has also signalled his intention of closer ties with the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, by envisioning the creation of a Bucharest-Washington-London axis of co-operation. Băsescu visited Tony Blair in London last month. Ties between the countries are expected to increase as the US moves its military bases from Germany to an area near the town of Constanţa, a Black Sea port in Romania.
Before Băsescu's arrival, Bruce Pitcairn Jackson, the president of Project for Transition Democracies, said that Romania and Bulgaria are the "success stories" of Southeastern Europe and that the two cuntries' EU accession, expected in 2007, will significantly increase the prospects of democracy in the Black Sea area.
Analysts also say that, due to the support of the United States and the United Kingdom, Romania will become the most powerful force in Southeastern Europe and a source of democracy and prosperity.

US Pulls Out of Optional Protocol to Vienna Convention

In a two-paragraph letter from Condoleezza Rice to Kofi Annan, the United States has left the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes. 
This treaty, which the United States remains within, gives foreign citizens the right to demand that they see a home-country diplomat when detained. The optional protocol, that the United States just left, puts disputes about those rights under the International Court of Justice. 
State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan said, "The International Court of Justice has interpreted the Vienna Consular Convention in ways that we had not anticipated that involved state criminal prosecutions and the death penalty, effectively asking the court [International Court of Justice] to supervise our domestic criminal system... [Withdrawal from the protocol is a way of] protecting against future International Court of Justice judgments that might similarly interpret the consular convention or disrupt our domestic criminal system in ways we did not anticipate when we joined the convention."

Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa officially resigns

After a week of swirling rumors, Hong Kong's leader Tung Chee-hwa announced at a press conference today at 5:36 p.m. that, "An hour ago, I tendered my resignation as Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Central Government." It has not yet been officially accepted by Beijing, though it is likely to pass as a formality.
Though Tung cited health reasons for his decision, it is widely believed he was given the signal to resign by the central government of the People's Republic of China. 
"I am 68, because of long hours, 16 to 18 hours a day has taken toll on my health. The third quarter of last year, I began to feel very exhausted, and my immunity is not as good as it was before. Doctors told me that my health used to be good, but if I work this particular schedule continuously it won't do. Doctors asked me to change lifestyle, if i don't comply, my health will be in decline and will suffer from more exhaustion." 
When asked whether he was pushed out by Beijing, Tung replied, "That is not the case at all. The central government has repeatedly affirmed the work that I and my colleagues of the SAR government have done, so that is not the case at all." 
Tung had become extremely unpopular in the last few years, culminating in a July 1, 2003, rally when over 500,000 people demonstrated against his handling of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the economy and controversial state security provisions. 
With his resignation, chief secretary for administration Donald Tsang will take over as provided by the Basic Law. A special election is required within 120 days according to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance. 
In his final comments, Tung expressed regret in his inability to complete his term because of his poor health. 
"The sense of attachment... with Hong Kong people is enormous, it's just a very special feeling. Its kind of sad to leave."

Blogshine Sunday pushes for government sunshine online

 
Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March 13, 2005. 
On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists. 
Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.
Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement.

Colombia extradites guerrilla to the USA

The communist FARC guerrilla named Omaira Rojas, or Nayibe Rojas Cabrera, or Nayibe Rojas Valderrama, or Sonia was extradited to the United States. The Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Velez authorized the extradition requested by a tribunal court in Washington.
The guerrilla was given to DEA officers Wednesday, March 9, at 3:25 p.m. in the airport of Barranquilla, Colombia.
Colombian and American authorities say that Sonia directly negotiates the delivery of narcotics to drug dealers from Peru and Brazil.
Sonia's lawyers said she could not be extradited to the United States since her real name was not determinated. They demanded a revision to the process. The government of Colombia didn't accept the arguments and Uribe signed the authorization for the extradition.

The MAS resist the efforts of the Bolivian government to eradicate . The use of coca is an old tradition of Bolivian Indians, as tea, medicine, and during social events. The cultivation of coca is a financial resource to Bolívia. Bolivia is considered the world's third-largest cultivator of coca, after Colombia and Peru.
However the coca is also the raw material for . Coca products are exported to drug cartels in , , , , and the as reported by arrested drug dealers.
The MAS is pressuring the government so the new Hydrocarbons Law can be approved. The law aims to raise the taxes levied on extraction. Mesa said that the law as stated is not viable.
Mesa has the support of part of Bolivian population. According to the analysts Carlos Valverde and Jorge Lazarte, Morales lost credibility with this crisis.
The opinion of Morales is that his public image has not deteriorated. He says that the Bolivian population will continue to support him. He also accuses Mesa of trying to favor the interests of oil companies, contrary to the interests of Bolivia. He announced that he will continue to organize protests against the government.
Labour unions and indigenous groups continue the blockage of roads in Bolivia to express their dissenting opinion against the government.

Bulgarian government says U.S. killed Bulgarian soldier in 'friendly fire' incident

According to Lieutenant Colonel Sevastian Dobrev, a Bulgarian defense ministry official, U.S. forces killed a Bulgarian soldier in what the army calls a 'friendly fire' incident in Iraq on March 4. The official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, told "Voice of America News" on Wednesday that Bulgarian military police in Iraq are convinced that 30-year-old Junior Sergeant Gardi Gardev was killed when several American troops opened fire on his convoy.
Dobrev said the shooting took place at night in a desert area, when Bulgarian troops and U.S. forces at a nearby radio post were not able to recognize each other. He said the trouble began after Bulgarian troops stepped out of their armoured vehicles to fix a problem with their communication equipment, about 160 kilometers southeast of Baghdad.
"At that moment one Iraqi car tried to pass them," he explained. "They tried to stop it, but the car did not want to stop. They shot two times in the north direction in that area. A few seconds after that our coalition partners from the United States from this radio post opened fire."
Lieutenant-Colonel Dobrev said two bullets hit machine gunner Gardi Gardev during the incident. He said colleagues tried to revive Sergeant Gardev, while an American helicopter was called in to take him to a hospital.
However, the helicopter did not land and another emergency vehicle arrived too late to save his life. Mr. Dobrev said the inexperience of American forces at the recently built radio post in the area contributed to what the army calls a "friendly fire incident."
"Our guys know exactly where they are deployed on the ground. They signed this place on their maps," he said. "But there was no contact, any kind of contact, between the Bulgarian battalion and the American radio post there."
Mr. Dobrev said Bulgarian and American military officials will meet in Baghdad Saturday to discuss how to improve coordination and the outcome of investigations by Bulgarians and two American teams.
He denied the incident has increased anti-American sentiment in Bulgaria, which is among several Eastern European countries supporting the US-led efforts in Iraq. Bulgaria has a 460-strong battalion in the Iraqi city of Diwaniya, serving under Polish command, and its mandate expires mid-2005.
Bulgarian soldier Gardev, who was buried Tuesday in his home village of Dolno Sahrane, was posthumously awarded the rank of candidate officer and received a medal for his apparent bravery in Iraq.
He died around the same time that American soldiers shot and killed an Italian intelligence agent, while also wounding an Italian journalist the agent had helped to rescue from insurgents. U.S. officials have expressed their regret over both incidents. On March 7, the Bulgarian government stated that Jr. Sgt. Gardi Gardev was killed by U.S. troops. 
Officials from 1st Corps Support Command of the Multi-national Force Iraq are investigating the incident, and have said that they are committed to working with Bulgarian officials to discover what happened.

The "", as it is named, calls for all member states to adopt a ban on human cloning, which it says is "incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life."
The , which has long pushed for a complete ban, voted in favor of the statement while traditional ally , where is legal and regulated, voted against it.
The statement should have no impact on countries that allow therapeutic cloning, such as Britain and South Korea, as it is not legally binding.
"The foes of therapeutic cloning are trying to portray this as a victory for their ideology," Bernard Siegel, a attorney who lobbies to defend therapeutic cloning, said in a report. "But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning."

Six-year development framework for Sudan released by UN

The Joint Assessment Mission between the World Bank and the United Nations released on March 9, 2005, a plan for the development of Sudan over the six years remaining between January's peace agreement and the vote in 2011, in which southern Sudan will decide whether to break away from the north. The plan, titled "Framework for Sustained Peace, Development and Poverty Eradication in Sudan," describes two phases, the first through 2007, the second through mid-2008. The first phase will focus on emergencies and the repatriation of refugees, while the second will consist of "major infrastructural programs", according to the Sudan Tribune.
While the majority of the $7.8 billion needed for the development described in the plan will come from sources within the country, the plan asks for $2.66 billion from other countries. According to Reuters, the UN's Joint National Transition Team will hold a conference to ask for money in Norway in April.

China's first private airline Okay Airlines (奥凯航空 Aòkǎi Hángkōng) took off on its maiden flight today from Tianjin (200km north of Beijing) to Changsha (in Hunan province, central China) to Kunming (in Yunnan province).
The airline tried to start last Saturday, but it had problems with the paperwork from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The price of a ticket was CNY 1,180 (US$ 143), but customers for the first flight got a 40% discount.
According to China Daily, three more private airlines will exist: Shanghai-based "Spring International Airlines", Chengdu-based "Eagle Airlines", and Gansu province-based "Huaxia Airlines".

BBC's political show makes special edition from Shanghai

The BBC's political debate show Question Time aired a special edition from Shanghai yesterday. This was the first time that a political show from the West was made in China. The show was broadcast on BBC One and BBC World; however, it wasn't shown in China, as a condition of the programme amid fears that it would be inflammatory and present negative views of the government.
The panel contained the Chinese politician Liu Jianchao,who is the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman and Long Yongtu who is General Secretary for the Boao Forum for Asia, together with Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, Isobel Hilton, a writer who has a large knowledge of China &amp; David Tang, fashion designer.
The audience contained a mixture of Chinese and Westerners together with people invited by the government. The questions concerned, among other things, the next chief-executive of Hong Kong, China's attitudes toward Taiwan, whether China has growing problems concerning spoilt children, the growing human rights question, and whether China will economically overtake America in 20 years time.
Many members of the audience liked the show and hoped a similar show will be broadcast in China, in a few years time. The program, which was part of a week-long BBC focus on China, was hailed as a sign that China was becoming more liberal and accommodating to Western media presence and involvement in China.

Many infertile American women want sex selection

Many infertile American women would choose the sex of their next child if given the option.
A survey of 561 women being treated for infertility has found that 41% would use sex selection if it were offered at no cost. 
Contradicting fears that such sex selection would cause gender imbalance, the survey found that women with no children would choose baby girls and boys in approximately equal numbers.
Furthermore, women with only daughters wanted to select a male child while women with only sons wanted to select a female child.
"Sex selection is a topic that's almost taboo for physicians to talk about," says study lead author Tarun Jain of the University of Illinois at Chicago. "Prior to this study, there has been no data to indicate what the demand might be."
Of 561 survey respondents, 229 would want to select the sex of their future child. 
Among these, 45% had no children and 48% had children of all the same sex. 
Half would choose to select the sex of their next child even if they had to bear the cost. 
About 55% would choose sperm separation, 41% would choose preimplantation genetic diagnosis and 4% would choose neither.
Sex selection is controversial. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes it for nonmedical reasons and so does the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. 
The American Society of Reproductive Medicine supports it for nonmedical reasons for family gender balancing provided methods used are safe and effective. 
"As the techniques gain more popularity, physicians will have to decide if they will offer the procedure to patients with and without children," says Jain.
The research is reported in the journal "Fertility and Sterility".

Judge threatened Michael Jackson with jail

An angry Judge Rodney S. Melville threatened to issue a bench warrant for the arrest of world famous pop singer Michael Jackson if he failed to appear at the Santa Barbara County Superior Court in California Thursday Jan. 10, 2005. Jackson is under indictment there on seven counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14, and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent. Jackson, held briefly under the threat of jail by authorities on Nov. 20, 2003 when charges brought against him were formalized, gained his freedom later that day by posting a $3 million bail.
Judge Melville, apparently frustrated with Jackson who had in two earlier instances caused delays in his court room, issued the warrant just 5 minutes after noting the singer’s conspicuous absence at the scheduled 8:30 a.m. proceedings. Jackson's defense lawyer, Tom Mersereau Jr., advised the judge that Jackson awoke earlier that morning with severe back pain and was under treatment at an area hospital at the time. The judge moved to give the celebrity one hour to appear or face arrest for contempt of court.
As word of the warrant threat traveled to the large news presence gathered outside, a media countdown began. During the countdown, live televised reports recounted how Jackson had arrived for court 20 minutes late on his own arraignment for these charges, only to be met by a stern lecture from Judge Melville for that transgression. There was also another occasion where Jackson, while recovering from flu symptoms, delayed the trial's jury selection for a week until he was well enough to return. The glaringly clear message sent by the judge was: bad back or not, Jackson was to appear in court! And fast! Only the televised scene of Jackson's expectant defense lawyer Mersereau with his assistant Susan Yu, both busy on cells phones while tensely waiting curbside beside the court house for the Jackson motorcade, seemed to undermine a feeling that Jackson would make it in time to avoid having his bail revoked.
As the deadline came and passed without Jackson’s arrival, live reports were busy with speculation on the superstar persona of Michael Jackson then taking on newer aspects of super-bizarre. But Jackson’s flair for tardiness showed itself with an arrival that was a mere 3 minutes after the judge was being forced to make good on his threat. Dressed in a blue blazer over a light weight undershirt, the star's recent departure from the hospital was evident by the pajama bottom pants and open-heeled bedroom slippers he wore into the court room.
Jackson had the assistance of his father and a body guard at each side to keep him steady as he gingerly walked into the Santa Maria court house. He listed slightly to the right and kept a fixed, distant face that was surrounded by uncombed strands of his long hair. The summons issued by the judge forced Jackson from his hospital bed to show the world he was not above the law. 
In private chambers, Judge Melville met with both the prosecution lawyer, Tom Sneddon, and Jackson’s defense lawyer to verify the defendant’s claims of back pain. After re-taking the bench in the court room, the judge announced to the jury they would proceed with the docket as planned. Mr. Jackson narrowly escaped prison, and the trial would continue where it left off on the previous day with direct testimony from the now 15 year old boy who accuses him.

The Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera are reporting that US forces may not have been informed of the operation to rescue kidnapped Italian journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, in which the intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US troops.
The Italian government disputes this account, and has said that the US was fully aware of the operation on March 4.
La Repubblica is reporting that US forces were aware of Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari's presence, but not the specific details of his mission.
Speaking in the La Repubblica newspaper, General Mario Marioli assisted those involved in the operation in Baghdad, by obtaining a special badge for them from coalition forces upon their arrival. 
However, as the deputy commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Marioli reported that he was unaware of Calipari's purpose in Iraq, so he could not tell coalition troops on the ground the details of the Italian mission.
According to La Repubblica, Marioli reported that he "had no contact with US intelligence officers" prior to the shooting.

Defendant shoots Judge, three others at Atlanta courthouse

A defendant on trial for rape in Atlanta, Georgia reportedly stole a deputy sheriff's handgun and used it to shoot the judge, court reporter, and two deputies Friday morning. Three people were killed and one was wounded.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rowland W. Barnes has been confirmed dead along with the court reporter and one of the deputies. After the shootings, the suspect reportedly attempted to carjack several cars in a bid to escape. He attempted to carjack a green Honda Accord with license plate 6584-YN, from a newspaper reporter, but eventually fled by other means. The reporter in question, Don O'Briant from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was beaten by the suspect but was fortunate to receive only cuts to his face and a broken face from a fall.
The car was listed as being used by the suspect in public alerts across the area before it was realised that the car was in fact still in the garage of the courthouse.
The suspect has been identified as Brian Nichols, 34, who was facing a retrial for rape and kidnapping after the first trial ended with a hung jury. Police are desperately searching for Nichols, as he is considered armed and dangerous.
The suspect reportedly stole the handgun by overpowering a deputy sheriff while he was being taken into the courtroom by the deputy, said Assistant Police Chief Alan Dreher. He then shot and critically wounded the female deputy, went to the courtroom where his trial was due to take place, and held about a dozen people at bay there before killing the judge and court reporter. He later shot and killed another deputy outside.
The deputy from whom Nichols stole the handgun is now sedated and in critical condition after surgery and has a bruise in her brain, according to Jeffrey Salomone, an attending trauma surgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital. Although she was shot in the head, the bullet did not penetrate her skull, said Salomone.

Garry Kasparov retires from professional chess

"Chess is life in miniature. Chess is battles, chess is struggles." said the longtime world champion Garry Kasparov at the height of his career. In a surprise announcement Friday, the grandmaster said he will retire. He went public with his intentions from , Spain after winning a prestigious tournament there. The news comes as Kasparov, now 41, declared an ambition to devote his energy into the politics of his native Russia.
Alternately known as brash, emotional and brilliant, the maverick Kasparov could be a formidable opponent in the realm of politics. He will partner with the Russian group known as the Committee 2008 (Komitet 2008), whose members are attempting to influence the 2008 Russian election that will replace Putin. The champion said he also wants to write books, with chess being among the subjects, but he will not play any more at the professional level.
Always mercurial in defeat, Kasparov lost his final game in tournament play in a stunning upset by of Bulgaria. The upset did not take away his victory at the tournament, but his announcement came after being bitterly stung in defeat. 
At age 22, Kasparov became the youngest person ever to hold the title of world champion when he won it from fellow Russian, Anatoly Karpov, in 1985. The two players dominated the field until infighting in 1993 caused Kasparov to break away from the (FIDE) and form the (PCA). In this forum he defeated British challenger . For a period of time, Kasparov, of the PCA, and Karpov, who reclaimed the top spot of the FIDE, both claimed to be world champions. However, the ratings system developed by FIDE held that Kasparov was the stronger player. The PCA eventually fell apart in 1995.
In 1996, Kasparov was at the top of his game, when a team led by IBM introduced , the strongest of a new class of chess playing computers. In a highly publicized face-off of man vs. machine, Kasparov won the 6 game match. A year later, against an enhanced version of Deep Blue, he lost. He blamed the loss on a variety of factors, including fatigue against his tireless opponent.
While the machine found a new place in the chess world, and while a new generation of chess players favored "", where the fast pace of play does not allow for deep calculation, Kasparov turned his attention to taking on the world.
The Kasparov vs. the World online chess game in June 1999 brought together chess players from around the world in a cooperative effort to beat the reigning world champion. With more than 50,000 individuals submitting move votes, Kasparov vs. the World was one of the largest interactive gaming events in history. Kasparov won this match.

Atlas V rocket launches with Inmarsat satellite

A built V launch vehicle, successfully launched from , at 21:42 (4:42 p.m. ). It placed the Inmarsat 4 F-1 communications satellite into orbit. This was Lockheed-Martin's second try to launch the satellite. Yesterday's attempt ended in a scrub when the flight control computer passed a red-line with less than three minutes remaining in the countdown.
This was the fifth launch of the Atlas V vehicle, and the first launch where the rocket used three of the first stage, Aerojet built, solid rocket motors. It also had the narrower 4 meter payload fairing. 
For the first part of the flight, the rocket was powered by a common booster core with two RD-180 rocket engines plus three solid rocket motors. When their fuel was expended the solid rocket motors burned out and were jettisoned. 
The common booster core then continued pushing the payload and upper stage, with its two RD-180 engines producing 806,000lbf of thrust. The common booster core expended its fuel around four and a half minutes into the flight. At this point the first stage common booster core separated from the upper stage and payload.
After the stage separation, the Centaur upper stage started its engine and burned for nearly ten minutes. During this burn, the payload fairing separated from the spacecraft, leaving the satellite exposed on the nose of the rocket in the vacuum of space. When the ten minute burn was up, the Centaur coasted with the satellite for another ten minutes waiting to get to the optimal point for the final burn. At around 24 minutes into the flight, the final burn of the Centaur stage occurred, placing the spacecraft in a super-synchronous transfer orbit. After this burn was complete, the Centaur separated, leaving the spacecraft on its own. 
Now the spacecraft must attempt to open its solar arrays and place itself in the final . Because of this special type of orbit, where the spacecraft goes around once every 24 hours, the satellite will appear to sit in one place over the equator. From this location, Inmarsat will use it to provide BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) which is a 3G compatible, 432kbit/s data service, to much of the world. 
The Atlas vehicle was rolled out of its vertical integration facility 1800 feet from the launch pad early yesterday morning (before the first launch attempt). The reason for this launch day move is because of the clean pad concept. 
Past American rockets (with the exception of the Saturns and Space Shuttles) have always been assembled on the launch pad. In the case of a delay in launching, this would cause delays in all the rockets that needed to be launched after the one that experienced the delay. With the new clean pad concept, rockets can be assembled and checked out before being moved to the pad, saving delays in the schedule. 
The launch tower and rocket move out to the pad along a set of railroad tracks, making the 1800 foot journey in approximately half an hour, topping out around two miles per hour. 
Because of the clean pad concept, none of the launch control electronics or spacecraft environmental systems are on the pad. Instead, they are run along the railroad tracks with the rocket as it moves to the pad on launch day. When they get there, they slide into concrete enclosures so that they are not destroyed during the rocket launch.

3 dead as man on trial for rape escapes

During the trial of a man yesterday for rape at an Atlanta court house, the man on trial allegedly stole the gun of a nearby deputy and shot dead the Judge, a reporter and another deputy. The suspect, Brian Nichols aged 33, was at court for the fourth day of his trial for numerous charges filed by a former girlfriend. Nichols was being tried a second time after his first trial ended in a hung jury (8-4 for acquittal).
After fleeing the court house Atlanta police assumed he drove away in the reporters car and issued a nation wide "look out" for the vehicle. The car was found later parked in the courthouse garage. He is still at large, and a massive police hunt is under way. The prior day to the incident, Mr. Nichols was found to have two handmade knives hidden in his shoes. Georgia prisoners often make "shanks" to try to fend off gang rapes while in custody.

Criminals kidnapping mother of soccer players, in Brazil

 
The mother of Brazilian soccer player Luis Fabiano has been kidnapped. According to the television channel TV ESPN Brasil, the kidnapping occurred Friday, March 11, by morning in Ponte Preta district, Campinas, of São Paulo.
The police are not giving too many details, and a great part of local media is not reporting the case, afraid of putting the life of Fabiano's mother at risk.
This is the third kidnapping of a soccer player's mother in four months. On February 23, Ilma de Castro Libânio, 51, the mother of the Brazilian soccer player Edinaldo Batista Libânio, 25, known as Grafite was kidnapped. 
On November 6, 2004, the mother of Robson dos Santos, or Robinho, was kidnapped.
In both cases, the hostages were released and they are well, and the police arrested the suspects.

Canadian airline Jetsgo ceases operations; 17,000 stranded

Jetsgo, Canada's third largest airline, has ceased all operations because of spiralling oil prices and a federal safety investigation. 
The low-cost carrier had been expanding rapidly in recent months, having added four new routes in December alone. However, the sharp increase in oil prices has forced the airline to ground all flights. The airline, which has 1,200 employees and 29 planes, lost C$55 million (US$49 million) in the past 8 months alone.
The move has stranded over 17,000 passengers across its routes. A spokesperson from Canada's transport department commented, "They'd grown too fast and it was putting strains on senior management."
No arrangements were made with Air Canada or other airlines to take care of their customers. The Air Canada web site stated that "no arrangements were made by Jetsgo that would enable Air Canada to accept Jetsgo tickets."

US Senate passes new bankruptcy bill

In a vote of 74-25 last Thursday, the US Senate passed a measure that would change laws, making it harder for individuals seeking relief from their debt burden to avoid repayment. Almost twenty Democrats joined Republicans, who currently hold a majority of the seats in the US Senate, in passing the bill.
Lobbyists for credit card companies and financial services firms have worked for the bill during the last two administrations. A similar measure passed both the Senate and House during the previous administration, but then President Bill Clinton the measure in 2000.
Amendments defeated.
Democrats sought to soften the bill by allowing bankruptcy filers to negotiate directly with lenders for relief, but the amendments were defeated by the Republican-controlled Senate. Proponents of the bill claim the rise of bankruptcy filings to nearly 1.5 million a year shows that abusers of credit use the filings to shield themselves from irresponsible practices.
"There has been an explosion of bankruptcy," said Iowa Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley, the bill's sponsor. "We preserve the principle of a fresh start, but we also establish a principle that if you have the ability to repay some of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free." However, Massachusetts Democratic Sen., said, "This legislation makes the bankruptcy courts of the United States the collection agency for the credit-card industry." 
The bill impacts a broad spectrum of law, but the most significant impact is on personal bankruptcy filings. Individuals who get behind in repaying credit card debt face high interest charges and stiff late payment fees. By only meeting minimum payment requirements, borrowers remit to the lender over the life of the loan an amount in interest and other fees that can far exceed the value of the principal balance of the loan. This can put consumers who run up high balances on various cards at financial risk of default. Critics of the bill blame these aggressive lending practices as a contributing factor in the rising trend of bankruptcy filings from 1996.
Debt from medical bills also affected.
The proposed bill doesn't only affect debtors with credit card debt.
It also affects debtors who have run up large medical bills.
Patients with a past medical history that disqualifies them from full medical coverage, can easily find themselves facing insurmountable medical bills after just a short stay in the hospital. These individuals will no longer be able to get a fresh start after these personal disasters, and will be forced to live in poverty until they can pay off their medical bills as part of their Chapter 13 filing. (Prior to this bill, they would have been able to file Chapter 7, completely discharging their debt.)
, which accounts for 70% of bankruptcy filings, allows individuals to eliminate most non-secured debts after liquidating assets, with the notable exemption of one's principle residence in most states. The Senate passed bill would change Chapter 7 eligibility by applying a means-test, where those with a median income higher than the state average would be required to file under provisions. Under Chapter 13 protection, an individual's debt is not forgiven; rather it is restructured for payment under more lenient terms.
Attorney client privilege and insurance affected.
This was the first major overhaul of federal bankruptcy law in many years.
Under the old bankruptcy law, a personal bankruptcy attorney could not be held financially responsible for his clients mendacity. Under the new bankruptcy law, the bankruptcy attorney is responsible for his client's lies to the Court about his assets and the bankruptcy attorney and his insurance carrier can be held responsible by the Bankruptcy Court.
The result is that personal attorneys (this does not apply to corporate bankruptcy attorneys) are likely to flee the personal bankruptcy field when the new law takes effect. Their companies will not offer the sort of coverage that they would need to continue to practice. 
So when consumers need to file personal bankruptcy under the new law, they will be unlikely to find a bankruptcy attorney to represent them. Consumers will have to file pro se: such consumers will be likely to fail due to the complexity of the law.
The bottom line is that the field of personal bankruptcy law as a practice area of law will cease to exist when the new bankruptcy law takes effect, and consumers will be unable to secure legal counsel and so consumers will lose what legal protections counsel now affords them.
Prison population affected.
Under the new bankruptcy law about one half million Americans will be forest to pay for at lest 5 years on longer they will be held in servitude as chattel they will be completely subservient to a dominating influence of the company that holds the loan. Their loan will be put on the market for sale for profit. The people will be forced to work harder. People who fail to go to court will have a arrest warrant made out in their name and people who refuse
to pay. They will be subject to fines and or jail. About fifty thousand Americans will punished by a fine and or about three 
thousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike they will be put in jail for life.
House vote up next.
The bill has the support of President Bush, and its passage in the House sometime next month seems likely. If enacted into law, lending companies will recover more money on what otherwise would be written off as bad loans. Those persons of median and higher income seeking relief would be required to file under Chapter 13 status and pay up to $100 per month under court imposed conditions. It is expected the proposed changes would cause a sharp increase in filings before the new law could take effect.

British 13-year-old given life for rape of teacher

A British boy has been ordered to be detained for life for the rape of his teacher. He was just twelve years old when he attacked the teacher in County Durham last November.
The Crown Court heard that the boy had attacked the female teacher after a one-to-one session, and then drove the teacher's car away from the scene before abandoning it thirty miles away.
The boy, who also suffers from learning difficulties, admitted to the rape in court.
The defence told the court how the boy had been the victim of sexual abuse since he was very young. At just three and a half, concerns had been raised over his 'sexualised' behaviour. By four, he had been encouraged to experiment with alcohol and cigarettes. 
But judge Mr Justice Grigson told the boy: "Despite your very young age, it is quite clear that you knew what you were doing." 
The judge told the boy that he must serve at least 21 months of his sentence but will most likely be behind bars for much longer. He will also be on Britain's Sex Offender Register for all of his life.
The agencies which should have protected the boy in his early life have launched an enquiry into their failings.

FBI suspect Jesse James captured in Rio after five years on the run

Brazilian federal police arrested Jesse James Hollywood, aged 25, in Saquarema city, Rio de Janeiro, on March 8.
James had been sought by the FBI for more than four years.
According to the police, he was living in Saquarema with a woman who is pregnant. His arrest occurred while they were in a mall.
James was deported to the United States for trial. The two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty.
On Friday, James appeared in a Santa Barbara, California court for arraignment on charges of kidnapping and murdering a 15-year-old boy.
James will plead not guilty, according to his attorney, James E. Blatt.
Blatt also criticized the portrait prosecutors had painted of his client.
"Have you ever seen a 20 year-old mastermind? He was not the shooter. He was not at the scene," said Blatt.
Blatt requested that the trial be continued on April 4.

Suspect in Georgia courtroom slayings caught

The suspect in the triple murder at a courthouse in Atlanta, Georgia, yesterday surrendered to police after holding a woman hostage in her apartment overnight.
Police believe the suspect, Brian Nichols, may also have killed a U.S. Immigration and Customs agent as he fled to the suburb of Duluth northeast of the city. It is unclear whether the hostage ended her ordeal with Nichols by escaping, or was simply let go, when she reported the incident to the 9-1-1 emergency service.
A multi-agency manhunt for the suspect ended this afternoon with a SWAT team surrounding the apartment of the former hostage. Nichols was able to watch events as they unfolded outside the apartment on the television of his former hostage. Charles Walters, Gwinnett County police chief, said Nichols "literally waved a white flag or a T-shirt and came out to our folks."
The body of federal agent David Wilhelm was found shot to death hours earlier about 15 miles from the scene of the arrest. Police have not directly linked Nichols to the murder, but note that the victim’s pickup truck, badge and pistol were missing.
Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said of the woman who was held hostage, "It’s my understanding that he had told her, 'If you do what I say, I won’t kill you.'"
Nichols has been taken into federal custody. The ATF announced that they have charged him with possession of a firearm by a person under indictment, while they prepare to file additional charges.

A bright object was seen falling over the night sky across the Pacific Northwest, at about 7:45 p.m. Pacific time March 12. Eyewitnesses from as far south as Northern California and as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia reported seeing the object falling in the western sky.
“The object began as a small white dot roughly the brightness of a planet, and quickly became a brilliant blue-green color with a long spark-like tail of yellow specks. From my vantage in Southeast Portland, Oregon it moved roughly from south to north and at a 45-degree angle downwards through the sky. I also saw two flashes of white light as the object disappeared behind the hills on the west bank of the Willamette River,” reported Wikinews contributor .
It is not known if the object impacted, but it was witnessed to fall over the Pacific Ocean.
The last reported meteor impact in the Oregon area happened in May 1981.

Last November, the Edeka supermarket chain offered in one of its Rülzheim stores fingerprint identification as method of payment. Customers can have their fingerprint put on file and begin using the system as an alternative to cash or card. Customers then place their finger on the scanner to complete a purchase.
The supermarket owner Roland Fitterer claims the system shaves 40 seconds off checkout time and plans to introduce it into his other 5 stores.
Internet and biometrics services provider, it-Werke, is the technology company behind the effort. The supermarket is their third client to adopt what it-Werke calls its digiPROOF technology.
There was sufficient interest among store customers that 100 registered to use the system. The chances are one in 220 million that two people have the same fingerprint.

A Russian helicopter crash near Grozny, Chechnya killed 15 of the 16 servicemen aboard, leaving one seriously injured. The Mi-8 helicopter hit a power line before bursting into flames when it struck the ground on Thurs March 10.
Video footage of the scene was broadcast by NTY television. Early speculation that the crash was the result of hostile fire seems doubtful at this time. Investigators were able to recover the flight recorder to help establish the cause of the crash. Russia has lost helicopters due to ground fire in the Chehnyan region in the past, but pilot error or malfunctions have also been to blame.
Interfax quoted a source within the Russian military as saying the helicopter was transporting 7 intelligence officers being sent into the region for “anti-terorist activities”.

Syria affirms withdrawal intentions

UN special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen said in a telephone interview Saturday from Beirut that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made "a firm commitment" for a two-stage pull out of forces in Lebenon. Roed-Larson met with the leader at his Aleppo home late last week for talks on Syrian intentions of following the UN Security Council Resolution 1559.
The US and French backed resolution calls for the complete withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon and reaffirms Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. It is hoped that the withdrawal will be completed prior to the Lebanese election scheduled for early May.
A complete plan and time table for full withdrawal is not yet known. White House national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, said the United States is waiting for details of the meeting with the special envoy. According to a report in the Washington Post, the first part of a pull-out calls for one third of the troops to be either removed or relocated into eastern Bekaa Valley and to shut down intelligence headquarters in Beirut by the end of March. Then on April 7, a Lebanese-Syrian military commission will meet to discuss the removal of additional forces.
The Washington administration seems prepared to accept a Syrian withdrawal in phases, but is cautious of al-Assad's pledges. Hadley said on a 'Fox News Sunday' broadcast interview: "In the end of the day, it's going to be deeds, not words, that matter."
The assassination of Lebanese former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Feb. 14 galvanized anti-Syrian opposition and foreign pressure that was calling for an end to the Syrian presence. It is estimated their total military force is now 15,000, with an additional 5,000 intelligence assets, down from a high of 40,000 during years of Syrian involvement. Syria occupied Lebanon beginning in 1976 when the country was at civil war. Associated Press and US intelligence reported significant troop movements out of Lebanon beginning in earnest last week amid differing protest groups in Beirut who marched both for, and alternately against, the Syrian involvement.

For Slovakia to adopt the euro in 2009, it must join ERM II in 2007. Three new members, Slovenia, Estonia, and Lithuania, have already joined ERM II and are on track to adopt the euro in 2006–2007.

Dutch member of Parliament proposes to abolish the Cabinet

The Dutch member of parliament Geert Wilders has finished his statement of principles, which sets out his political plans for the future. The 20-page statement is referred to as 'Onafhankelijkheidsverklaring' (Declaration of Independence) by Wilders. It is a continuation of a ten-point plan written by Wilders and former colleague, Gert-Jan Oplaat, and proposed to Wilders' former party, the VVD.
The ten-point plan caused disagreement between Wilders and the VVD, including a difference of opinion on whether to allow Turkey to enter the EU. Wilders left the VVD on September 3rd last year. He started a political party of his own, known as Groep Wilders (Group Wilders). Though he did not have enough votes during the last election, he refused to relinquish his seat in parliament to the VVD.
In his statement, Wilders proposed among others to abolish certain ministries. Wilders also proposed outlawing the further creation of Islamic schools and closing mosques that proclaim extremist views. Furthermore, he proposed that the number of provinces be reduced from 12 to 4, the five islands of the Antilles be expelled from the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the number of civil servants be cut by 50%.
Because of his marked views, public opinion of Wilders and his statement is strongly divided. As a result of his criticism of Islamic extremism, Wilders (along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali) received several death threats, which are taken very seriously after the murder on Theo van Gogh by an Islamic extremist last year and the assassination of political icon Pim Fortuyn in 2002. He is being held in a secure location, where he organises dinners for €2000 to raise money for his campaign.

Protesters rally in Beirut

Dueling between protest groups continued yesterday in Beirut at Martyrs' Square where hundreds of thousands demonstrated in opposition to Syrian forces inside Lebanon. It is estimated the rally consisted of nearly a million people, making it twice the size of the one organized last week by the Shiite group Hezbollah who call for Syrian forces to remain in Lebanon.
Monday's rally also marks the one month anniversery of the assassination of former anti-Syrian Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Crowds wearing colors of red and white to show their unity fell silent as church bells tolled at 12:55 in observance of his death and the hour it occurred.
Protesters also sought to undermine support for Prime Minister Omar Karami, who was reinstated after the opposition movement had succeeded in forcing him out. Karami, and President Emile Lahoud who reinstated him, are both pro-Syrian. The sheer size of the demonstration that shouted chants of "Freedom, sovereignty, independence" puts the momentum of the debate back on the opposition movement's side.
According to the Associated Press, the number of people attending this demonstration makes it one of the biggest anti-government protests in the Arab world. If the police estimate of one million participants is correct, one in four inhabitants of the country attended the rally.
The US State Department has dubbed the movement "Cedar Revolution."

Brazilian President party received money from FARC, say documents

Documents of the Brazilian Agency of intelligence (Abin) say that the Workers' Party received 5 million dollars to be used by political campaign of candidates in 2002 from the Colombian communist armed group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP). The information was reported by the Brazilian magazine Veja that circulates this week in a headline story called "FARC's tentacles in Brazil".
According to the magazine, reporters had access to documents of Abin that described the liaisons between the Workers' Party (PT) and the Colombian guerrilla movement FARC.
The Workers' Party (PT) is the party of the Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. PT is one of the biggest left-wing parties in Latin America and at this moment the strongest and more organized party from Brazil. It is one of the political Brazilian parties that has the biggest and most active militancy.
Abin's main document, number 0095/3100 of April 25, 2002, says that a meeting occurred on April 13, 2002, in a farm near Brasilia. The meeting lasted about 6 hours, there were approximately 30 persons, among them the father Olivério Medina, one of the representatives of the FARC in Brazil, and members of PT. A disguised Abin's agent participated of this meeting and annoted everything.
According to the agent, during the meeting, father Medina announced that he would donate 5 million dollars for politicians' electoral campaign of his choice.
Abin agency has six documents that describe the liaisons between PT and the FARC. Among the six documents, 3 of them say explicitly that 5 million dollars donation for PT's candidates occurred. The money probably came from Trinidad and Tobago and went to 300 Brazilian businessmen who distributed the quantity among the party's committees.
Another document says that the Brazilian Congress employee and former-militant of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCdoB), Maria das Graças organized the meetings with FARC members. She is considered a personal friend of the FARC commander knows as Mauricio. Maria said: "I know him [the commander Mauricio] off course, and so what? I did not organize any meeting."
The militant Antonio Viana who was in the meeting said: "We have talked about everything, except money."
The Colombian Radio Caracol says that, according to a research done by the Colombian government, the FARC invests next to 476 million pesos per years in activities in foreign countries. The official FARC representatives for this work are: Luis Alberto Albán, Ovidio Salinas, Ricardo Morantes, Jairo Alfonso Lesmes, father Oliverio Medina, Jesús Carvajalino and Liliana López. Father Olivério Medina is the name of who would be responsible for the intermediation between members of political parties in Brazil and the FARC.
Sometime ago, the Brazilian Deputy Alberto Fraga (PTB) knew about the Abin's investigation and denounced the scheme during a speech on the Brazilian Congress. In addition, he tried to open a commission to investigate the matter. Nevertheless he did not obtain support to open the commission. The PT deputy Luis Eduardo Grenhalg told him that he might be processed by government if he continued on commenting about the subject, says Fraga. Grenhalg says that he only suggested for Fraga not spreading informations that were not real. 
The PSDB candidate José Serra tryed to talk about the FARC-PT liaison during the 2002 presidential campaign. However he was punished by the Electoral Court at that time.
The Workers' Party (PT) released an official statement signed by the National President José Genoino repudiating the magazine's article and denying all presented facts. Part of the note tells:
The note says that the article is irresponsible, that it comments on facts without any sustentable evidence. It still says that the magazine denies itself when later in the text it affirms that it did not find any solid indication to proof that 5 million dollars were really sent to PT by the FARC.
The note affirms that this kind of insinuation is not new and the party was already a victim of it before. It says that during the 2002 presidential campaign the candidate José Serra (PSDB) was punished because his denunce was empty. The documents commented by the magazine date of April 25, 2002, epoch in which the Brazilian president was Fernando Henrique Cardoso. At that time there were many spies searching and collecting, like snakes, for situations that could prevent the free desire of the Brazilian people to vote for the changes.
Some members of the National Congress are trying to begin a official investigation.
This is the second time, this year, that a South American government is criticized for alleged supporting relations with the FARC. Last month, Colombia and Venezuela almost entered in a war because of the arrestment of the alleged FARC's chancellor Rodrigo Granda. Colombia accused the government of Venezuela of giving protection and support to FARC's guerrillas. Venezuela accused Colombia of hurting his sovereignty. The two countries only entered an agreement after the intervention of the president of Cuba Fidel Castro.
Also this is the second time, in less than a month, that a political party from South America is accused of implication with the FARC. On February, Paraguayan authorities discovered Cecilia Cubas Gusinky's body, 31 years, daughter kidnapped of the former-president of Paraguay Raul Cubas in a hole, in Ñemby, 29 km from the capital Asuncion. Members of the party Pátria Livre were living in that place and they were considered to be the main suspects. Osmar Martínez, that belongs to the party, was arrested. According to the police, some time ago he had communicated by email with the FARC chancellor Rodrigo Granda. In a interview Martinez said that he supports a "brotherhood relation" with the FARC.
The presence of the FARC in Brazil.
A note from the Workers' Party (PT), of February 16, 2002 called 
"The truth about Colombia and the FARC - and PT" tries to clarify the relationship between the party and the FARC. A portion of this note says that:
The note also criticizes the decision taken during the previous government, of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which did not recognized the Colombian guerrillas of the FARC diplomatically. According to the note that would not be a good idea, since the FARC could win the war against Colombia.
The note criticizes the support of the government of the United Sates to Colombia and affirms that with it the conflict tends to remain more violent and last more. In relation to the drugs, the note affirms that the PT is emphatic in the combat against the drug traffic. Nevertheless it says that there are credit "contradictory informations" relating to the implication of the FARC with the drug traffic.
The PT refuses to classify the FARC as a terrorist organization. The party justifies the decision saying that it can act as mediator in the conflict, this way.
The FARC is member of Foro de São Paulo since 1990. According to the first forum final resolution, on July 4, 1990, the forum goal is "to improve proposals of united and consensual acctions".
Raul Reyes, FARC commander described part of the FARC relationship during an interview for the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo on August 24, 2003 . In the interview he said that he knew the Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula for the first time in San Salvador during the Foro de São Paulo. The FARC commander affirms that the main contacts in Brazil are the ones in the Worker's Party (PT) and in the Landless Workers' Movement (MST). He says that FARC has contacts among intellectuals, Catholic priests, historians and journalists. Among them there are Carlos Alberto Libânio Christo or Frei Betto (former Lula advisor) and Emir Sader (writer). Also he says that the affirmation that the FARC produce cocaine is untrue.
The Brazilian drug dealer Luiz Fernando da Costa, also known as Fernandinho Beira-Mar, was arrested by Colombian army on April, 2001 in the city of Maramduba, in Colombia. With him there was also arrested the FARC leader, Acacio Medina, or Negro Acácio — O Estado de São Paulo, on April 21, 2001.
In Brasilia, Beira-Mar was interrogated by DEA agents. Beira-Mar talked about his liaisons with the Colombian guerrillas. The recording of this conversation was a key factor so the US government could request later the extradition of three other FARC guerrillas. Some details of this meeting were published by the Colombian magazine Cambio 
According to Beira-Mar, he was buying 600 kilos of coca, per week, for two million pesos from peasants. He was paying to the FARC a million pesos for every processed kilo. He also said that he was giving weapons to the Colombian guerrillas.
FARC and ELN delegates act in schools, labour unions and Brazilian universities spreading ideas about the revolutionary movement. 
Some of these meetings are organized by left-wing groups. One of the most
active of these groups is the "Permanent Committee of Solidarity with the People in Fight". The committee organized more than 40 lectures in São Paulo
according to the President of the USP Workers Labour Union 
On August, 2001, representatives of the FARC, took part of a meeting with the members of the Socialistic Youth of PDT .
On March 20, 2002 in Ribeirão Preto, a pro-FARC committee was created by the secretary of sports at that time Leopoldo Paulino (PSB), during the government of Mayor Antônio Palocci Filho (PT). Palocci is the current Minister of the Finance , 
During a interview to the Brazilian television channel EPTV, yesterday, Leopoldo Paulino said that the comitte did not aim collect founds to the Colombian guerrilla. He said that the committee is of solidarity with Latin American people, engaged and militant. He said that he doesn't think that the FARC need any other extra financial support. Paulino said he has empathy by the guerrilla because they fight against the United States. He also said that he did not take part of the meeting described by the Brazilian magazine and that he don't know father Olivera Medina. 
On 2001, FARC commanders were received by the governor (at that time) of Rio Grande do Sul, Olivio Dutra (PT) ,
. FARC leaders were honored and acclaimed during the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Olívido Dutra is the current Minister of Cities. At that occasion, deputies of Rio Grande do Sul Congress protested against Olivio. 
Brazilian press.
The Brazilian press already have published stories about the relationship between the FARC and the Workers' Party (PT). But, none of these previous stories was so emphatic as the recent one published by the magazine Veja, this week.
However the magazine Veja is cautious saying that although all the people and the dates cited by the Abin agents were correct "the magazine did not find solid evidences to proof that PT received money from the FARC". 
In the story, the magazine did not detail the participation of the FARC on the Foro de São Paulo, neither its activities in Brazil. 
FARC and PT have been in contact at least for about 12 years at least, since the FARC joined to the Foro de São Paulo in 1990. Foro de São Paulo was founded after the falling of Berlin wall by Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the Cuban President Fidel Castro.
America Libre is the name of a magazine published by some participants of the Foro de São Paulo. The America Libre magazine publishing conseaul is formed by PT members and other Brazilian personalities: Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh (PT), Fernando Morais, Emir Sader, Roberto Drummond, Gilberto Carvalho, Leonardo Boff, Rubens Paolucci Jr, João Pedro Stédile (MST leader), Chico Buarque de Hollanda (singer), etc. Also part of the publishing council is the FARC commander Manuel Marulanda Vélez (Tirofijo). . The former-president of the publishing council was Carlos Alberto Libânio Christo, know as Frei Betto, former Lula's personal advisor and journalist.
Activities of the Foro de São Paulo usually are not not mentioned by Brazilian media. Even the story of magazine Veja this week didn't say the name Foro de São Paulo. Instead the magazine preferred to use "a debate with political parties and social organizations of Latin America and of Caribe to discuss the effects of the fall of the wall of Berlin." Rarely the name Foro de São Paulo is mentioned by Brazilian news agencies. 
Some journalists already denied the existence of the Foro de São Paulo. Luiz Felipe de Alencastro already wrote articles for the magazine Veja. He is Brazilian History professor in the University of Paris. In October 30, 2002, during a talk for the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington, a participant asked Alencastro about the Foro de São Paulo. Alencastro answered: "It's interesting. You'll see, because I live, I mean, I live now in France. I had been living in Brazil for 12 years. We never heard about this Foro de São Paulo in Brazil."
Documents about the Foro de São Paulo can be find in left-wing party websites.
, 
. PT talks about the Foro de São Paulo in its documents 
At the website of the Perseu Abramo Foundation, organization founded by PT, there is the speech of the President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva during the meeting of the Foro de São Paulo in Havana, Cuba. 
An article published in the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) official webpage by the journalist and Vice-president of PCdoB José Reinaldo Carvalho called "São Paulo Forum - the convergence point of the Latin-American and Caribbean left" talks about the Foro. PCdoB is an ally and the party participates on the government .
In 2004, a group of journalist sent a proposal to the Brazilian president Lula asking for the creation of an inspector organism to control the conduct of the Brazilian press. This organ would have power, according to the proposal, to censure journalistic works considered inappropriate. Journalists could lost their professional licenses. , , , . 
The proposal was considered too authoritarian by other journalists who protested against it emphatically. The law had no support for its creation, in spite of the pressure exercised by the government, and by some journalistic sectors supporting the proposal 
One of the critics against the proposal was that the journalists who supported the idea (and that would be the ones who would fiscalize the media) were members of PT or PCdoB.

Judge strikes down same-sex marriage ban in California

Superior Court Judge Richard A. Kramer struck down two California laws that limited marriage in the state to a union of opposite-sex couples. The ruling came one year after when it opened its city hall to same-sex weddings over Valentine's Day weekend through March 11 2004.
Kramer said the two California laws violated the state's constitutional guarantees of privacy and a legal concept called due process - which tries to ensure each person is treated equally by the law. "The denial of marriage to same-sex couples appears impermissibly arbitrary," Kramer wrote in the opinion released Monday.
In his decision, Kramer cited United States Supreme Court case law ranging from ' to ' in a step-by-step dismantling of legal arguments against same-sex marriage. Including the following excerpts:
Kramer, a Catholic Republican Judge appointed by , California's previous conservative governor, issued a "stay" on his order, making it a tentative decision by delaying its implementation for 60 days to allow the same-sex marriage opponents time to file an appeal to his ruling. The case is widely expected to be brought before the California Supreme Court.
Less than a year ago, the state's Supreme Court annulled more than 4,000 same-sex marriages which took place in San Francisco County in 2004. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, but ruled more narrowly that San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom overstepped his authority by unilaterally deciding not to follow state laws he did not agree with instead of challenging the laws in court, which is the proper legal way to overturn or affirm laws in California and much of the United States.

Beijing cracks down on manhole cover thefts

Beijing's utilities are cracking down on manhole cover thefts by removing the incentive to steal them. A pilot program is using a new material with negligible recycling value in over 2,921 installations of various types.
"We are still looking for the perfect substitutes for the manhole covers," said city spokesman Wang Xin.
Over 240,000 covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in 2004, nearly half of the 600,000 installations scattered throughout the city.
The high recycling value of the metal used to manufacture the previous models led to a crime wave of thefts, driven by illegal scrap metal dealers who purchased them for approximately US$2.4 dollars.
The covers cost between US$145 and US$182 to replace.

Taiwanese political parties propose &quot;anti-invasion&quot; laws

Two Taiwanese political parties of the independence-leaning "pan-green alliance" unveiled new bills today in response to the new "anti-secession" law passed earlier this week by the People's Republic of China.
The Democratic Progressive Party is expected to introduce a bill giving the President of the Republic of China the power to take "non-peaceful" action, or other actions, to "safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and territory". The draft version of the law mandates that the Taiwanese President must report to the legislature on any such actions within thirty days.
DPP caucus whip Peter Lin said that although the signatures of only thirty lawmakers are required to make the law valid, over fifty have already been gathered.
The seven-article draft law states that the Taiwan issue is not a part of China's internal affairs, but rather that it is an international matter between nations. It goes on to state that it is necessary and urgent to quickly enact counter-legislation to deter Mainland China's annexation efforts. It further calls for increased trust and understanding between the two sides, including greater trade, sporting, and cultural links.
The Taiwanese Solidarity Union also proposed a new "anti-annexation" law. The eleven article draft states that "Taiwan is already an independent sovereign state and it is not an issue for Taiwan to declare independence or seek separation from China". It goes on to state that the government should call a referendum to amend the Taiwanese constitution to safeguard Taiwanese sovereignty. The draft law would also give the Taiwanese President authorisation to resort to "non-peaceful means" to resist Chinese aggression.
Taiwanese independence has been a thorny issue in recent years, as some Taiwanese politicians insist that the democratic island is a sovereign nation, and Chinese authorities insist that it is a part of the PRC.

China enacts historic &quot;anti-secession&quot; law

By a vote of 2896-0 (with two abstentions), the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has passed an "anti-secession" law designed to thwart Taiwan independence. Chinese President Hu Jintao quickly signed a presidential order to bring the law into effect.
The law provides a legal basis for China to use force, or "nonpeaceful means" as the Chinese government has phrased it, against Taiwan, should reunification efforts fail. 
Chinese premier Wen Jiabao stressed that the legislation is aimed at achieving peace in the Taiwan Straits. 
Speaking at a press conference following the law's passage, Wen stated, "This law is meant to strengthen and promote cross-straits relations. This law is for peaceful reunification. It is not targeted against the people of Taiwan, nor is it a war bill."
"This law is to contain and oppose Taiwan separatist forces. Only by containing and opposing Taiwan separatist forces can the Taiwan Straits have peace," he added. 
The vote was broadcast live on state-controlled television and radio. The Chinese Xinhua news agency has taken the unusual step of setting up a special section on its Internet site to explain the law and its ramifications from the Chinese perspective.
Chinese officials describe PRC policy as being committed to peace to the maximum extent possible, while acknowledging limits to peaceful negotiation. A Xinhua headline from the days leading up to the law's passage declares, "China Pursues Peace, But Not at Any Price." 
Wang Zhaoguo of the National People's Congress previously stated on March 8, "Using non-peaceful means to stop secession in defense of our sovereignty and territorial integrity would be our last resort, when all our efforts for a peaceful reunification prove futile." Added Wang, "No one is more desirous of achieving a peaceful reunification than we are."
Taiwanese politicians reacted with strongly-worded "anti-invasion" legislation, and vowed to call a one-million strong rally in opposition to the new law. 
The timing of the legislation comes at a delicate moment for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is making her first trip to China in a few days.
"We do view the adoption of the anti-secession law as something that is unfortunate and not helpful to encouraging peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan.

Suspect in Atlanta courthouse shooting appears at hearing

Brian Nichols appeared before Cobb County Magistrate Judge Frank Cox on Tuesday, four days after fleeing Atlanta in a killing spree. The hearing took place inside a Fulton County jail. Accompanied by nineteen security officers and shackled at the hands and feet, Nichols only words when asked if he had any questions were, "Not at this time."
The 5 minute hearing was a formality to re-file charges of rape against him. He will be charged with 4 counts of murder and is currently being held with bond.
Nichols allegedly shot the judge presiding over his rape trial along with two others present at the time in an Atlanta courtroom. He then fled to a suburb outside the city. Later that evening, it is allegeded he shot a US customs agent before taking a woman hostage in her own apartment, alluding the massive manhunt.
Nichols ultimately let the hostage, Ashley Smith, go free. He surrendered peacefully to a SWAT team after Smith alerted authorities.

Ex-WorldCom Chief found guilty of all charges

A federal jury found Bernard Ebbers guilty of all nine counts in the indictment brought against him. The verdict was handed down by a New York jury after 8 days of deliberation on the former WorldCom CEO and mastermind behind the accounting scandal that brought down the telcom giant. 
AP writer Erin McClam reports, "Ebbers' face reddened.", as the verdict was read. Sentencing is set for June 13 when he will face up to 85 years in prison.
Ebbers testified in his own defence, saying he left the details of the company's accounting to others and that he had no knowledge of shady practices. But Scott Sullivan, ex-chief financial officer and key prosecution witness, directly linked Ebbers to the fraud. He had agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence for his own involvement in the fraud.
The demise of WordCom sparked a massive class action law suit by investors. The drastic plunge of WorldCom's stock value cost upwards to $11 billion as the scandal unravelled. Secuities fraud case filings stemming from the suits will probably break new legal ground whereby the actions of investment banks and public accounting firms will be called into legal question.

Mother of the Detroit Tigers baseball player Urbina was kidnapped by FARC leader

Venezuela recognized that the mother of Ugueth Urbina, Maura Josefina Villareal, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as "El Chiguiro". Urbina is a Venezuelan and a Major League Baseball right-handed closer who plays for the Detroit Tigers.
Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.
Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela. 
For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela. 
According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers.

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer makes 2005 Budget speech

The United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Right Honourable Gordon Brown PC MP, in a speech to the British House of Commons today presented his ninth Budget, what is very likely to be his last Budget before the next UK General Election. This opened the parliamentary debate on the 2005 Finance Bill, and was followed by responses from the opposition parties.
In a 48 minute long speech, the Chancellor presented a Budget of "tax cuts that are reasonable, spending that is affordable, and [economic] stability that is paramount", that was "the prudent course for Britain". There were few surprises that had not already been indicated in his 2004 pre-Budget report. The increase in the threshold on stamp duty was greater than that forecast by commentators, as was the amount of the Council Tax rebate to households with pensioners.
The Budget in detail.
Duty.
Before the speech, commentators had speculated that the Chancellor would increase the threshold for stamp duty on house purchases from £60,000 to £100,000 (the same increase that the Liberal Democrats had proposed in their Alternative Budget in February 2005), to reflect the increase in house prices over the past few years and to reduce the burden on first-time house buyers; and would not increase the duty on petrol. In his 2004 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor had committed to no increases in the duty on spirits, in advance of the duty stamps scheme scheduled to be introduced in 2006.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the threshold for stamp duty on house purchases would increase from £60,000 to £120,000, effective from 24:00 March 16, 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the rates of duty on spirits, cider, and sparkling wine would remain frozen at their current levels.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced a 1 penny increase in the duty on beer, and a 4 pence increase in the rate of duty on wine, effective from March 20, 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced a 7 pence increase in the duty on cigarettes, effective from 18:00 on March 16, 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced a refund of the VAT incurred by local councils in expenditure on childrens' services; and an extension of the refund, of 100% of the VAT incurred by church renovations, to 2008.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced the deferral of the increases in the duty on most fuels, to September 1, 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that there would be no increase in the rate of vehicle excise duty.
Taxes.
In his 2004 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor had announced a payment of £50 to households with someone aged 70 or over in 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced a Council Tax credit of £200 for households with someone aged 65 or over in 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that Income Tax Allowance would increase from £4745 per annum to £4895 per annum.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the rate of capital gains tax was remain frozen at its current level; and a raise in the inheritance tax threshold from £260,000 to £275,000, from April 6, 2005.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the rates for Corporation Tax and Company Car Tax would remain frozen at their current levels.
Benefits.
No further changes to the savings threshold for benefits elegibility had been expected. In the 2004 Budget, the Chancellor had already announced that the threshold would increase from £3,000 to £6,000 from April 4, 2005. In his 2004 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor had announced
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that child tax credit would rise by 13% over 3 years, to £63 for the first child and £111 for 2 children, and that child benefit would rise to £17 per week.

Business.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced 
Employment.
In his 2004 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor had announced the extension of the length of maternity leave from 6 months to 9 months, beginning in April 2007.
Stating that he had augmented his Budgetary goal of "forg[ing] a British way to stability" with a goal of "forg[ing] a British way to success", in his Budget report, the Chancellor announced 
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that paid maternity leave would be further extended to 1 year.

In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the £7,000 higher subscription limit on ISAs would be extended to April 2010, one year further than that indicated in the pre-Budget report, increasing the maximum total tax-free saving over the lifetime of such accounts to £100,000.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that Pension Credit would increase by 13% to £119 per week.

Memorials.
In his Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the construction of a memorial to the Queen Mother would be funded by the issuance of a new coin, commemorating the Queen Mother's 80th birthday.
Responses from opposition parties.
Conservative.
In a speech lasting 16 minutes the leader of the Conservative Party, the Right Honourable Michael Howard QC MP, repeatedly accused the Chancellor of presenting a "vote now, pay later" Budget. Mr Howard stated that he agreed with the Prime Minister that this would be "the last Budget that this Chancellor will ever deliver".
Mr Howard began by welcoming "the Chancellor back to the General Election campaign", and throughout his response made frequent references to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He stated that the Conservative Party's policy would be to give pensioners a £500 council tax rebate in 2005.
Expanding upon his "vote now, pay later" theme, Mr Howard stated that "this Chancellor has got form", describing Mr Brown's 2001 pre-election Budget as "a vote now Budget" and Mr Brown's 2002 post-election Budget as "a pay later Budget". Mr Howard also questioned the accuracy of the forecasts in the Budget report, accusing it of being a "dodgy Budget based upon dodgy numbers", and pointed to Mr Brown's Budget reports in previous years where the forecast in the Budget report had been for a surplus of £58 billions but where there had actually turned out to be a deficit of £41 billions. Mr Howard accused "the Chancellor's forecasts of surpluses" of being as unreliable as "the Prime Minister's forecasts of Weapons of Mass Destruction".
Liberal Democrat.
In a speech lasting 15 minutes, the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, the Right Honourable Charles Kennedy MP, emphasized themes of "social justice" and "fairness", and contrasted Liberal Democrat Budgetary policies with those of the Labour Party and of the Conservative Party. 
Mr Kennedy began by pointing to the "favourable backdrop" against which Mr Brown was publishing his Budget, stating that one of the reasons for the favourable economic circumstances was the implementation by the Labour Party of the Liberal Democrat policy of an independent Bank of England.
Accusing Mr Howard and Mr Brown of engaging in a "Dutch auction" with respect to Council Tax rebates for pensioners, and of both ignoring the "ticking bomb" of Council Tax revaluation that would markedly affect people's Council Tax bills, Mr Kennedy stated the Liberal Democrat policy of scrapping the Council Tax entirely and of instead bringing in a system of local Income taxation. Mr Kennedy characterized the Council Tax rebates as a "quick fix for this year only", and contrasted this with local Income taxation which he characterized as being one that "pensioners benefit from every year". Mr Kennedy also questioned why the National Audit Office would not have "access to Mr Brown's books", for checking the assumptions made in the Budget report, until the end of the year.
Further outlining the Liberal Democrat aims for "social justice" and "fairness", Mr Kennedy accused the State Pension system of being one that is "iniquitous" for women, whom he said both lose National Insurance credit as the result of time taken off work for starting and raising families and who have to rely upon the State Pension more because of their greater life expectancy. Mr Kennedy also stated that the poorest 20% of people in Britain pay more, as a proportion of their income, than do the richest 20% of people.
Mr Kennedy concluded by pointing to the lack of any mention of the environment in Mr Brown's speech, which he termed a glaring "sin of omission", and by describing the Liberal Democrat presentation of its taxation and spending policies as being one of "That's who'll pay it. That's what it will cost. That's who'll benefit.", and accused the Labour Party of, by contrast, making pre-election promises in the past to not raise Income tax, only instead to raise National Insurance contributions after the election.

Vodafone buys Connex and Oskar

Vodafone, the world's largest mobile telephone company, has bought Romanian operator Connex and Czech operator Oskar in a deal worth 2.6 billion euro. Both Connex and Oskar were majortarily owned by Telesystem International Wireless Group, a Canadian corporation. While officials from the companies did not make public the individual value of the two operators, it is expected that most of the 2.6 billion euro was paid for Connex, which has a market value of 1.5 to 2.3 billion euro.
The takeover of Connex is said to be the biggest deal in Romania in 15 years. Before the takeover, Vodafone owned 20.1% of the company, while now it owns 99.1%, the remaining 0.9% being owned by a Cypriot company.
Arun Sarin, the CEO of Vodafone, said "I am delighted that [Connex] and Oskar, both fast growing mobile operators, will become part of Vodafone."
Connex is Romania's second-largest mobile telephony operator, with more than 4.9 million customers at the end of 2004 and nearly 50% market share. It is also one of Romania's most recognised and successful corporations, and one of Europe's fastest growing mobile phone operators. Oskar has 1.83 million customers and is also growing at a fast rate.

Suspect in Atlanta courtroom shooting gets hearing

Brian Nichols appeared before Cobb County Magistrate Judge Frank Cox on Tuesday, four days after fleeing in a killing spree. The hearing took place inside a jail. Accompanied by nineteen security officers and shackled at the hands and feet, Nichols only words when asked if he had any questions were, "Not at this time."
The 5 minute hearing was a formality to uphold the rape charges against him. He will be charged with 4 counts of murder and is currently being held with bond.
Nichols allegedly shot the judge at his rape trial along with two others in an Atlanta courtroom. He then fled to a suburb outside the city, where later that evening he shot a US customs agent before taking a woman, Ashley Smith, . Smith was held by Nichols in her own apartment for 4 hours while he eluded a massive .
Nichols ultimately let Smith go free. He surrendered peacefully to a team after she alerted authorities.

Mars studies find water

Studies of Mars point to evidence of the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface and a vast amount of underground ice near the equator within the past few million years. Liquid water is believed to be a key ingredient for life, therefore the presence of water on Mars helps support chances of extraterrestrial life, reported the journal Nature today. In the studies, strong indications of glacial and volcanic activity were presented. The combined research on this subject, including a study in December 2004 indicating that five volcanoes were active as recently as two million years ago, justifies further search for signs of life on Mars scientists say.
A few million years is a mere minute on the geological timescale of Mars which has been around for 4.5 billion years.
The scarred surface of Mars cannot be attributed solely to asteroids. New images of the landscape taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the European Space Agency's Mars Express Mission show that flowing water, large glaciers and active volcanoes have also taken their toll on the face of Mars.
Some evidence collected by two Mars rovers that NASA sent to explore the planet shows that Mars was hotter and more humid millions of years ago than it is today. Also important were active volcanoes that can stimulate the forming of microbial life as they do here on Earth. Scientists recently discovered bacteria near the mouths of undersea volcanic vents on Earth where bacteria live off sulfur instead of oxygen and discharge methane as a by-product of their life cycle. Though controversial, the discovery of signs of methane gas in Mars' atmosphere also interests researchers who believe it indicates the possibility of subsurface life.
Geologist James Head of Brown University led a group of researchers who examined landforms thought to be glacial during the Viking program in the 1970s. They found evidence that glaciers moved from the poles to the equator between 3.5 and 4 million years ago, suggesting that Mars is currently in an interglacial period. 
A third study looked at an area of frozen water roughly the size of the North Sea that formed near the equator around five million years ago. It is now thought that the ice was once liquid water carried along by volcanic eruptions in a region known as Cerberus Fossae.
Researchers have long assumed water on Mars had all evaporated into the Martian atmosphere. A 1991 hypothesis, then considered outrageous by suggesting Mars was no stranger to floods, is now supported by recent findings. The HRSC data suggests water is still present both in liquid form and ice. Mars Express will deploy a special radar instrument in early May which should be able to detect water and ice even several miles beneath the surface.
Should water be found on Mars, the chances of finding life are great. Many extremophiles, bacteria living under extreme conditions such as extreme salinity or heat, have already been discovered on Earth. In February 2005, scientists announced the discovery of bacteria that survived in a state of frozen suspension for 32,000 years. 
Likewise on Mars, a sample of ice could offer great insight into the evolution of the Martian environment and atmosphere. These discoveries may offer a great chance to get objective evidence for Mars research.

The Woodcraft Folk loses subsidy

London – The Woodcraft Folk, a British socialist inspired youth organisation, lost its government subsidy of GBP 52 000. The Department for Education and Skills said the organisation's claim for a grant lacked detail and that they did not have “sufficiently robust outcome indicators”, meaning that it did not represent a “good value for money”. This is the first time in 40 years the group was denied funding by the department.
Loss of the grant puts the future of the organisation in doubt. The grant money provides a fifth of the funds that helps pay for its full-time staff and headquarters. The rest comes from donations, subscriptions and a grant from the Co-operative Group
Some members of Woodcraft Folk have charged that the real reason the funding was stopped is the group's strong support against the Iraq War. It has helped lead some of the anti-war movements. 
It now plans to mount a campaign to get the funding back.
The Woodcraft Folk started in 1925 as a socialist and co-operative alternative to the Scouts, who were seen as increasing militaristic in the years immediately after the First World War.

Mao-style suits fading away in China

The famous "", prominently worn by Chinese leaders in the decades following that country's , is on the verge of disappearing from China, as the fashion-conscious younger generation shuns the previously common style in favor of the latest apparel offered by modern designers.
China's President Hu Jintao was last seen in a green Mao suit while visiting a military base during the .
During the recent gathering in Beijing, Sun Fucai, manager of the official Red Capital clothing store, reported that Mao suits made up only five percent of his sales.
One shopkeeper near Beijing, Hu Bixing, sells Mao suits, but hasn't worn his own Mao suit for about ten years. He says they are "...so out of fashion."
In China, the style of dress is still worn by older urban dwellers, and many farmers still wear the hat which typically accompanies the suit, called a "Liberation" cap.
The Mao suit has a long history in China, going back to 1912, when it became known as a "Zhongshan suit", because , or Sun Zhongshan as he is more commonly known in Chinese, popularized the style as the president of the Republic of China. It was later made famous by the during his reign as the leader of China.
One Mao suit owner remembers purchasing what for him was a very expensive version of the suit when it was more popular several decades ago.
"I haven't worn it in 20 years," said government-employed driver Zhang Xiaotong. "If I put it on today people would look at me like I was a bit odd."

50 Italian parliamentarians call for global summit for &quot;a new financial architecture&quot;

A letter and motion to be debated by Italian Parliament this week calls for action to address speculative bubbles and potential future financial crashes in the global economy. The motion asks for a global summit similar to the 1944 Bretton Woods United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, which gave us the IMF and World Bank.
The letter raises questions about the sustainability of current financial trends, based on the highly speculative nature of today's markets. For example, according to the letter, "It is estimated that the entire financial bubble, counting all financial derivatives and all other forms of existing debt, is equal to about $400 trillion, compared to a worldwide GDP of slightly more than $40 trillion".
Last years collapse of Italian dairy company Parmalat, with "14.3 billion euros that must still be accounted for", is given as evidence for "a lack of effective tools and controls regarding financial operations". Enron, which famously collapsed in November 2001 revealing faudulent accounting practices from previously respected accounting firm Arthur Andersen, is given as another example.
Oddly, the largest collapse on record, that of WorldCom, is not mentioned, though the set of examples is not purported to be exhaustive. A number of other crashes are mentioned: the LTCM fund, Argentine bonds, Cirio, and Finmatica.
The motion, linked to supporters of the Lyndon LaRouche movement, is signed by Parliamentarians Lettieri, Soro, Delbono, Tolotti, Widmann, Villani Miglietta, Rosato, Albertini, Morgando, Diana, Luigi Pepe, Damiani, Ostillio, De Brasi, Maccanico, Carbonella, Paola Mariani, Grandi, Pistone, Giovanni Bianchi, Giacco, Benvenuto, Piscitello, Camo, Realacci, Squeglia, Rocchi, Iannuzzi, Intini, Meduri, Santino Adamo Loddo, Boccia, Villari, Chianale, Siniscalchi, Sandi, Cusumano, Cennamo, Annunziata, Rotundo, Bonito, Buemi, Pennacchi, Fanfani, Tarantino, Rodeghiero, Angioni, Detomas, and Nesi.

Flexible displays soon to be in production

Roll up displays for use in hand-held gadgets will be available for mass production by March 2007 according to co-developer Philips. Working with US based paper pioneer E-ink, Philips have developed a 13cm wide screen which is just 0.1 millimetres thick and can be rolled up so that it is only 15 millimetres in diameter. 
The screen, which Philips hope to license to makers of in-car satellite navigation systems, mobile web browsers and smart phones, uses no back light and displays a monochrome image in four shades of grey as well as black and white. According to Philips the screen is able to give a “paper-like contrast”.
The screen consists of a backing layer of plastic film which contains a matrix of transistors. This is topped off with layer transparent “electronic ink” capsules and a layer of clear plastic. The capsules are approximately 50 micrometres in diameter and contain polarised black and white particles. Using the transistors, a pattern of positive and negative charge can be applied which manipulates the particles to form monochrome images.

Actor Robert Blake acquitted

Visibly relieved and sobbing as the verdict was read, Robert Blake was acquitted on all counts and walked out of the courtroom yesterday a free man.
Charged with murdering his wife, the jury acquitted Blake due to lack of evidence. He was also charged with two counts of soliciting to have his wife Bonnie Lee Bakley killed. The jury acquitted him on one count, and the judge dismissed the second after the jury became deadlocked in an 11-1 vote.
He was greeted by a crowd of cheering supporters outside the courthouse. The star of the television series "Baretta" crushed out one of his trademark cigarettes and spoke to the gathering, thanking his lawyers and private investigators who he described as, "This small band of dedicated warriors that saved my life."
In a speech that lasted 30 minutes, he talked of having to spend $10 million for his defense and said that he was now a poor man who needed a job. The 71 year-old actor also said he was ready to "cowboy it...Get in a motor home or van, feel the wind in my hair and find a little bar in Arizona or someplace."
The prosecution, which did not seek the death penalty, painted Blake as caught in a loveless marriage with Bakley. Tricked into marrying her by his love of their daughter Rosie, now 4, they claimed that he had felt trapped by a woman who had a history of being a low-life grifter. They alleged that Blake, frustrated after trying to find someone to kill his wife for him, killed her himself. They also claimed that he was the trigger man who, after dining with his wife in their favorite restaurant, put two bullets in her head as the two of them sat in their car outside. 
The jury foreman in the trial, Thomas Nicholson, described the prosecution case against Blake as "flimsy." He said "they could never connect all the links in the chain. We couldn’t put the gun in his hand." Blake's defense team was also able to successfully discredit witnesses who testified on the solicitation charges.

Tibetan activists are demanding that the People's Republic of China release Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family. Nyima, aged 16, is considered the 11th by Tibetan Buddhists. The Pachen Lama is the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism.
Tibetan activists say that Nyima and his family were kidnapped by Chinese authorities on May 17, 1995, just days after the boy was recognized as the of the 10th Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama. At that time the boy was 6 years old. Human rights groups claim that he is the youngest political prisoner ever.
The whereabouts of Nyima and his parents are unknown. The Chinese government claims to be protecting them because of death threats they have received and say that the boy is in school and that he and his family are happy.
Tibetans don't believe the government's version of the events and are campaigning for the Panchen Lama to be released. 
After the arrest of the Panchen Lama, China named a rival boy, Gyancain Norbu, the son of a communist, to the office. The new boy is not well supported by most parts of the Tibetan community.

Two dog attacks in a week puts Spotsylania County authorities in the spotlight to take action on pet owners for their dog's behavior. In unrelated incidences, an elderly woman was killed and another woman was bitten. Three dogs have been shot dead by police.
An 82 year old woman was walking her Shih Tzu breed of dog in her front yard last week when she came under attack by three Pit Bulls. She died being transported to the hospital after police responded and shot two of the attacking dogs. They later captured the third dog and euthanized it.
More recently, a 31 year old woman was bitten on her hand during a fight that ensued between two Pit Bulls in her back yard. The responding police officer shot the aggressor dog.
Public outcry over the death of the elderly woman stirred procecutors to charge the dogs’ owner, Deeana Large, with involuntary manslaughter. This is a first for the Commonwealth of Virginia where charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years are leveled in a case involving a pet's owner. In order to gain an indictment, prosecuters will have to prove the dogs' owner was criminally negligent. In the biting incident, the attacking dog’s owner faces a misdemeanor charge of letting the dog run at large.
Deeana Large, who initially said she owned only 1 of the 3 dogs involved in the mauling case, has not yet been formally charged and awaits indictment. Investigators in the case say there were earlier reports of her dogs allegedly killing a German Shepard and a kittten in her neighborhood. Complaints by neighbors spurred an animal control officer to be looking for the dogs at the time the woman was killed.

The late Robert McCartney's five sisters are visiting the United States in an effort to place pressure on the IRA. They are meeting with Ted Kennedy and other political leaders to gather support. They are also meeting with President Bush on St. Patrick's day, and will give him a dossier. They accuse IRA members of killing their brother during a brawl in a Belfast bar in January. Sinn Féin is also alleged to have attempted to cover up the incident by at least one of the women.
Catherine McCartney said to the BBC, "We have to be very careful that we're not being used by anybody and that includes Sinn Féin and all political parties, we're not stupid women... We get the impression that someone thinks out there that somebody's behind this, pulling our strings. The only person behind this is our Robert and he is the person pulling our strings."
In response to the killing, the IRA expelled three of its members and Sinn Féin expelled seven. Also, the IRA offered to shoot the men responsible for the killing, an offer which the McCartney family declined.
Two Sinn Féin candidates were in the bar on the night of the killing.

Maradona is in Cartagena recovering from stomach surgery he had to reduce the size of his waist. The surgury was necessary because Maradona is suffering of severe obesity problems which may put his life at risk. He is 5 foot 6 inches (1.67 meters) tall and weighs 267 pounds (121 kg). 
The Argentine was grateful for the homage and showed good humour:
"I want to thank the mayor for giving me the keys to the city. Even though I do not have the keys to my own house, I have a key to the people, like those of Cartagena, and it fills me with pride."

Robot Zoe detects life in Atacama Desert

&lt;br&gt;
Zoë, a four-wheeled robot constructed by Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, is the first rover-based system to discover life. Although the presence of life in the Chilean Atacama Desert is no surprise, Zoe is a step forward in an effort to design automated systems to find life on Mars.
Zoë, named after the Greek word for "life", is part of a three-year Life in the Atacama project at the Astrobiology Science and Technology Program for Exploring Planets (ASTEP). It was specifically designed to be deployed as a remotely-operated or autonomous rover.
The life Zoë was able to detect came from four elements. Zoë detected signs of chlorophyll, DNA and protein, which are strong indications of life. Scientists then gathered visual evidence from the pictures taken by Zoë. The research was presented this week at the 36th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas. The study was led by Nathalie Cabrol, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center.
One of the important new features developed for Zoë is a fluorescence imager in the shadow under its belly that can be used in daytime. This tool scans for chlorophyll-based-life that would otherwise be rendered undetectable by sunlight. Zoë also carries a spectrometer that scans for chlorophyll using visible and near-infrared light.
Zoë searched for signs of life in coastal and inland regions of the Atacama Desert between August and October of 2004. She was remote conrolled from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania while a ground crew followed her to verify her detections.

Wolfowitz picked for top spot at World Bank

The announced the selection of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, replacing John Wolfensohn who retires as acting president after 10 years. The switch is expected to occur sometime in June.
The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests. 
Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. "The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process." the IMF said in a statement. "Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made," it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.
Rob Nichols, the US Treasury spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, "Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board." Reuters reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program.

Tsunami exposes ancient ruins in India

Probably one of the first good things to come out of the 2004 Tsunami in Asia, ancient ruins were discovered in India. Fishermen along the shores report seeing the ruins along the shoreline near Mahabalipuram when the waters receded just prior to the arrival of the tsunami. Mahabalipuram is a port city of South India, dating back to the 7th century, around 60 km south from the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu.
The fishermen reported a complex consisting of ancient temples. Some mention seeing at least 20 distinct temples, and hundreds of refrigerator-sized blocks. The walls were covered with barnacles, coral and mud. Local folklore tells of an ancient port in the area.
On the shore, three structures consisting of elaborate carvings in the shape of animals were uncovered. The structures appear to have been covered in sand, which had been wiped away by the force of the tsunami. The structures appear to belong to a port city built in the 7th century, said T. Satyamurthy, a senior archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India. The sculptures, representing an elephant, a lion and a flying horse, were commonly used during the Pallava dynasty, which ran from the 4th to the 9th century, archeologists say.
The temples along the shores of Mahabalipuram are already a famous feature of the city, and have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Legend has it that the city was home to seven pagodas. Underwater excavations of the area by the archaeological society, run by the Indian government and navy divers, began on Thursday.

No talks until IRA &quot;criminal activity&quot; dealt with

Northern Ireland secretary Paul Murphy said there is "no hope" of political progress on peace talks until all IRA "criminal activity" has been dealt with.
Mr Murphy praised the courage of the McCartney sisters' campaign for justice for those responsible in the murder of their brother Robert McCartney. Their brother was stabbed and kicked to death after an altercation in a bar in the center of Belfast. The gang which killed him included at least three members of the IRA. 
Mr Murphy's comments came during a visit the sisters made to Washington. They met President Bush who is said to have offered support and encouragement for their campaign. Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, has pointedly not been invited to the White House. 
Belfast's self-governing assembly is the product of a peace deal made in 1998. It collapsed two years ago, leaving the British province to be run directly from London ever since. Attempts to restore the assembly have met numerous obstacles in the intervening years, mostly centered on the presence and actions of the IRA. 
In recent weeks the IRA has been linked not only to the murder of Robert McCartney, but also to the widely publicised theft from the Northern Bank of £26 million in December. 
"As far as the political process is concerned, to all intents and purposes we are not talking about any future negotiations or discussions until the issue about criminal activity on the part of the IRA is addressed," Mr Murphy has said. Until that happens, there "wasn't any hope at all" of progress to restore the institutions of government to Northern Ireland. He added that the McCartney sisters "remarkable campaign" had "personalised the issue of criminal activity" and given a face to individuals suffering from brutality and savagery.
Gerry Adams said the case has become steeped in politics, and the only people that could not be accused of political motivation were the McCartney sisters themselves. 
Reported separately, the controversial 'detention-without-trial orders', brought in last week under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, could be used against members of the IRA. The government has refused to rule out the possibility of control orders being used on members of the group. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said that the orders had been working well in their first few days although there had been some teething problems.

Drinking habits tied to genes

The amount of alcohol people drink may be influenced by their genes.
A new study has found a link between specific , drinking habits, and possibly alcohol addiction. 
The study, by UK researchers at the universities of and , involved data from nearly 1,000 people who provided detailed information about their drinking habits. 
The researchers focused on a gene that controls chemical signaling in the brain. 
Different versions of the gene may influence the balance and effect of signaling molecules. 
One genetic variant—a version of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene—was strongly linked with alcohol consumption. 
DRD2 appears to affect positive feelings from alcohol, meaning that people without the variant might find drinking less pleasurable. 
The research is reported in "The Pharmacogenomics Journal".

Fireball generated in U.S. laboratory resembles black hole

Brown University professor Horatiu Nastase has written a paper detailing calculations that suggest that a fireball created in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, may have been a black hole.
The fireball occurred as scientists conducted experiments involving the smashing of streams of gold nuclei together in the RHIC and is reported to have been three hundred times hotter than the sun. It absorbed more than ten times the predicted amount of energy and radiated it as heat, a behavior characteristic of black holes.
Scientists have reassured the public that this phenomenon does not pose a threat; the fireball existed for one millionth of one billionth of one billionth of one second (one second divided by 10 septillion — a 1 followed by 25 zeroes) and was not dominated by gravity as previously observed black holes have been, providing the energy for their cataclysmic appetites.

"Today, we carried out a successful test-firing of the indigenously developed Shaheen II missile," announced a Pakistani military official.
A statement issued by the Pakistani military noted that Pakistan gave prior notice of the test to nearby countries.
"The test was carried out to verify some of the refined technical parameters," the statement said, "Al Hamd-o-Lillah' (With the grace of God) all parameters were validated."
Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf congratulated the engineers and scientists who conducted the successful test.
"The capability was here to stay, will continue to go from strength to strength and no harm will ever be allowed to come to it," said Musharraf.
The "Press Trust of India" pointed out that the missile, "was capable of hitting targets deep into the Indian territory," and that the missile had been test-fired previously under the name "Hatf-VI", as a counterpart to India's "Agni-II" missile system.

Cassini discovers Saturn moon atmosphere

NASA's Saturn exploration spacecraft, Cassini, has discovered an atmosphere about the moon Enceladus. This is the first such discovery by Cassini, other than Titan, of the presence of an atmosphere around a Saturn moon.
Enceladus's gravity is too weak to hold an atmosphere around the planet, leading scientists to believe that volcanism, geysers, or gases escaping from the surface or the interior as a continuous source for the atmosphere.
The atmosphere was detected using a magnetometer during two close flybys of Enceladus on February 17 and March 9. The magnetometer is used to measure the magnitude and direction of magnetic fields surrounding Saturn and its moons. The magnetometer detected a bending of Saturn's magnetic field around the moon, indicating the Saturnian plasma is being diverted away from an extended atmosphere. The observations from the Enceladus flybys are believed to be due to ionized water vapor.
"These new results from Cassini may be the first evidence of gases originating either from the surface or possibly from the interior of Enceladus," said Dr. Michele Dougherty, principal investigator for the Cassini magnetometer and professor at Imperial College in London.
Scientists have suspected Enceladus as geologically active and a possible source of Saturn's icy E ring. Enceladus is the most reflective object in the solar system, reflecting about 90 percent of the sunlight that hits it.
Cassini first arrived in Saturn orbit July 1, 2004, releasing the Huygens Titan probe on December 25, 2004 which landed on Titan January 14, 2005.
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Today, Saturday the 19th of March, thousands across Europe marked the second anniversary of the US-led war on Iraq with protest marches and rallies for peace. 
Anti-war march in London: In London, UK, police said 45,000 people took part in a march following the traditional route; a Hyde Park start, past the US Embassy and finishing in Trafalgar Square. According to organisers, almost 100,000 people took part. There were no reports of violence or unrest at the rally.
In Istanbul, Turkey, about 15,000 people marched to protest against the continued US presence in Iraq.
Athens, Greece, was brought to a standstill by more than 5000 trade unionists who marched to the US Embassy.
Meanwhile, more than 400 miles away from London, in the Welsh coastal town of Aberystwyth, about two hundred people also took part in a peace rally. The first annual "All Wales Peace Festival" ("Gwl heddwch a chyfianwnder Cymru gyfan") took place on an unseasonably warm and sunny day for mid-March in the coastal town. 
Lasting about an hour, the rally made its way around the streets of the town, making its way to the ruined castle that overlooks the town, where the crowd heard speeches by a number of individuals, including Ken Booth, the head of Aberystwyth University's renowned International Politics department. There was no suggestion of violence at the rally, with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds making up the march.
Police presence at the march was moderately heavy yet restrained, with the police evidently not wishing for a repeat of the scenes two years ago when authorities were taken completely by surprise as protesters brought much of the town to a halt and occupied the council tax offices for two hours.
Attendance at all protests was a mere shadow of that just before the start of the 2003 war, when London saw over a million take to the streets to protest the imminent invasion.

Explosion kills 42 miners in northern China; 27 missing

Forty-two miners are confirmed dead and 27 are missing, after an explosion at the Xishui Mine in Shuozhou, a city in China's Shanxi province.
Six rescue teams are working at the site to rescue the missing personnel, according to Liu Jiwen, an onsite rescue consultant. Two miners were rescued earlier in the day.
Xishui Mine is licensed to produce 150,000 tons of coal per year. But the mine was ordered closed in 2004 for safety violations.
"In defiance of the order, however, mine owners have restarted production this year," stated a province-level official.
Police have arrested the owners of the Xishui mine.
Zhang Baoshun, the governor of Shanxi province, is on the scene to oversee the rescue work and an investigation of the accident.
Twenty-two other miners were working at the nearby Kangjiayao mine at the time of the accident, although it is unclear if any of those miners were affected.
Thousands of miners die in mining accidents each year in China. Today's accident comes just one day after 19 coal miners were killed in a mining accident in the Sulongsi mine in Chongqing, and one month after the largest accident in recent history killed 214 miners, in Fuxin, Liaoning Province.

Powerful earthquake rocks southern Japan, tsunami warnings issued

A powerful magnitude 7 earthquake rocked Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu at 10:53 am local time today (0153 UTC), prompting the Japanese Meteorological Agency to issue tsunami warnings for the area. The tsunami warnings were canceled later in the day.
A 75-year-old woman was killed in Fukuoka city by a falling wall. At least 400 people were injured by the quake. Local Fukuoka Airport and high speed bullet trains in the area temporarily suspended operations to look for damage.
According to the agency, the epicenter of the earthquake was in shallow water in the Sea of Japan, off the north coast of Fukuoka Prefecture.
Small aftershocks continued throughout the day, with authorities advising that residents should be prepared for aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.
In the aftermath of the quake, people were quickly alerted to the state of the situation by television reports, telephone, and text-messaging systems.
Interviewed by telephone in Hitoyoshi, well inland from the epicenter of the quake, a local resident noted the severity of the quake was frightening, and left the elderly woman unable to remain seated on a chair. Shutting off gas was the first priority, with the local television coverage providing a quick status update for the situation, followed by an interruption by national emergency network coverage.
A foreign resident of Fukuoka city reported taking refuge under his desk for several minutes as books and ornaments fell from shelves. He prepared to evacuate to high ground in case of a tsunami, but news reports indicated little danger from a tsunami. He also reported that Japanese residents appeared unconcerned by the quake, with many strolling near Momochi beach shortly after the quake, showing little apparent concern.
In Tenjin, downtown Fukuoka, Fukuoka Building's windows shattered, and the block was quickly cordoned off. In addition to Fukuoka Building, many other buildings and businesses remained closed to shoppers.
Wikinews contributor Oarih reports that a festive atmosphere pervaded the streets, however, as employees from Nishinihon Shimbun (a major Japanese newspaper) passed out one-page articles on the earthquake and curious onlookers investigated the damaged buildings and sidewalks. Many residents, relieved by the relatively low damage inflicted by the earthquake, started visiting pubs and restaurants at lunch for a celebratory beer. With train and subway services disrupted, queues over 100 people long formed at some Nishitetsu bus stops in Tenjin as dusk approached.
The penetration of modern text-messaging by the Japanese Keitai, the common Japanese cell phone system more prevalent than computer-based email, led to quick status checks on many family members located near the coast around Fukuoka, close to the quake's epicentre. Wikinews contributor Oarih reports that cell phone service providers were swamped by the spike in use, however, and both voice and text services remained unreliable for much of the day.

South American channeled apple snail discovered in Georgia

The American state of Georgia faces a new problem as wildlife officials discovered the South American channeled apple snail along the Alabaha River in Pierce County last month. Similar snails have been seen in four American states, including at least nine Florida counties, and Indonesia.
Apple snails (those of the "ampullariidae" family) are tropical and sub-tropical freshwater snails. They are named for their round shell, which is apple shaped. The channeled apple snail ("Pomacea canaliculata") has a yellow-to-brown shell that may grow to the size of a baseball. Unlike many other freshwater gastropods, Apple Snails have both a lung and a gill. This allows them to live even in oxygen-poor waters. Outside of their natural habitat of South America, the snails have no natural enemies. As they reproduce quickly and feed on aquatic plants, which provide food and shelter for native species, they can be devastating to their new environment.
"This discovery is one of particular interest because of the invasive nature of the species," assistant chief of DNR's Non-game Wildlife and Natural Heritage Section Jon Ambrose told the AP. "Because of the array of problems that can arise from releasing non-native species into Georgia's waters, we want to stress that this is not a responsible practice for pet owners."
DNR biologists searched the site of the discovery again last weekend. Although no more channeled apple snails were found, they may return for a more elaborate search. The Georgia winter, more severe than Florida´s, may put a stop to the threat.

Lebanon's opposition holds Syria responsible for Beirut explosion

The Lebanese political opposition group, dubbed the "Cedar Revolution" by the US State Department, claims Syria should be held responsible for a car bomb that rocked the Christian neighborhood of New Jdeideh in the capital city of Beirut, The blast occurred early yesterday morning.
"The security agencies belong to [Syria]. There is no other explanation. When security agencies come under Lebanese control it will be another matter," Reuters quotes opposition leader and Druze chieftain Walid Jumblatt as saying.
After the car bomb explosion, which injured eleven people, a series of fake bombs were discovered throughout the neighborhood. There were also and several sonic grenades thrown at pro-Syrian Lebanese Democratic Party offices.
"We warn Syria not to let these midgets carry out security actions in the country," Reuters quotes Jumblatt as adding.
"This has been the message to the Lebanese people...to sow fear and terror among Lebanese citizens if there is a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon," said Pierre Gemayel, a Christian opposition member who visited the site of the blast.

A piece of driftwood in the shape of a crucifix is listed for sale on eBay with a starting bid price of $25,000. The seller, known as "Marzipanda," from Scottsdale, Arizona lists its description as a "Natural Found Wood Jesus Christ Crucifix Cross Easter."
Maripanda describes the discovery of the piece as, "My very dear friend found this amazing natural driftwood while hiking a few years ago. So striking because it clearly resembles the Lord and all the details."
Expensive found art Christiana made international headlines in November 2004 when a Florida woman named Diana Duyser sold a partially eaten grilled cheese sandwich on eBay for $28,000 to Canadian online gambling website, GoldenPalace.com, after claiming she saw the likeness of the Virgin Mary burned onto the toast.
But not all high-priced Christian fare on eBay is of dubious value. A perusal of Christian-themed items as of March 20, showed 13,944 for sale on eBay. They ranged from other found art to some very expensive and authenticated rare art.
One such item has an eBay seller from Tel-Aviv, Israel listing a 19th century iron wall plaque with a starting bid of $30,000 and a shipping cost of $2,000, making it the most-expensive Christian religious item listed for sale on the auction web site.
Under the "Christian Icons" section of the site, the 14 cast iron plaques are advertised to have been made in 1855 and portrays "Jesus in Jerusalem" with the 14 stations of Christ.
Another high-priced Christian-themed item is a set of chalices and paten in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida for $3,550. The gold-plated silver is thought to have been made in the 1870s.

Violent protests break out in Kyrgyzstan over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections

At least 10,000 protesters stormed government buildings, burnt down a police station, and took control of an airport to prevent reinforcements from being flown into Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan today as they demanded the resignation of president Askar Akayev. The protesters claim that recent parliamentary elections were rigged.
According to a police source in the capital of Bishkek, four police were beaten to death in clashes with protesters.
Last week, Akayev warned civil war would break out if there was an attempt to copy the Ukrainian "Orange Revolution." However, the government says it wants a peaceful resolution. "We have never gone against our own people, especially not with weapons in our hands," Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev said.
Opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev says negotiations will only be fruitful if president Akayev himself is involved. "All other lower level negotiations will be just a waste of time," Bakiyev said.
The U.S. state department issued a statement saying the situation could be dealt with "according to the rule of law," and spokesman Adam Ereli said, "U.S. officials have been in contact with both the government and opposition to reinforce this message."
The OSCE stated the elections did not properly measure up to international standards, citing "lack of effective voter access to diverse sources of information, bias in the media, continued de-registration of candidates on minor grounds..., and inaccurate and poorly maintained voter lists."

Bush signs historic Schiavo bill into law

President Bush approved a historic bill designed to keep brain-damaged Terri Schiavo on life-support, shortly after it was sent to him by the US House of Representatives.
"Today, I signed into law a bill that will allow federal courts to hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life," said Bush's written statement.
Bush waited at the White House for the bill's arrival and signed it into law after returning early from a vacation at his Texas ranch.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 203–58 shortly after midnight in a rare Sunday session called at 9pm that night. Democrats objected to a call for unanimous consent earlier in the day. Although most members had left for the Easter break, 261 of the 435 House members returned for the vote.
Representatives debated the measure in the House from both sides.
Rep. , a Wisconsin Republican, said of previous rulings in Florida that they were "enforcing a merciless directive to deprive Terri Schiavo of her right to life." He continued that the House should "reinforce the law's commitment to justice and compassion for all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable."
Democrat of Florida disagreed, saying "Tonight this Congress is about to commit a travesty. Tonight congressional leaders are poised to appoint this Congress as a judge and a jury."
The US Senate had passed the bill by unanimous consent earlier in the day.
Terri Schiavo has been on life-support for over 15 years, and is currently cared for at a Florida hospice. She is considered by physicians to be in a "permanent vegetative state", while her parents contend that she is viable and that there is hope for recovery. Schiavo's feeding tube was removed on Friday after Florida courts ruled in favor of her husband, Michael Schiavo, who acts as her legal guardian in the matter. Terri Schiavo's siblings, and her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, challenge this decision.
"We are very very thankful to have crossed this bridge," said Suzanne Vitadamo, Terri Schiavo's sister. "We are hopeful, we are very hopeful, that the federal courts will follow the will of Congress and save my sister's life."

Car maker DeLorean dies at 80

Automobile industry pioneer, John DeLorean, died Saturday in a New Jersey hospital by complications from a stroke.
DeLorean was born in 1925 in Detroit, Michigan to European immigrant parents. He received an education in automotive engineering and quickly rose through the ranks of Packard and later General Motors (GM). DeLorean was credited with the development of the Pontiac GTO, which helped introduce the era of "muscle cars". By 1965, DeLorean led the entire Pontiac division, and four years later was promoted to the prestigious position of leading GM's Chevrolet.
In 1973, DeLorean quit General Motors and started his own company, the De Lorean Motor Company. The company's product was the DMC-12, an unusual car featuring an unpainted, stainless-steel exterior and gull-wing doors. The company started production in 1981 but failed less than two years later, having produced under 9,000 vehicles. Despite the company's failure and the car's dismal sales, the car itself gained a cult following after the release of the 1985 movie Back to the Future which featured the car as a time-travel machine.
DeLorean himself was in nearly as much trouble as his company. In 1982 he was arrested for attempting to sell $24 million worth of cocaine to undercover police, and after his company's failure, he became involved in a multitude of lawsuits alleging investor fraud. Though DeLorean successfully resolved the cocaine case after claiming entrapment, his other legal cases would drag on until 1999, when he declared bankruptcy.

EU concerned about Microsoft compliance, $5 million daily fine possible

Bill Gates's Microsoft could be fined as much as 5.0% of its daily income, roughly US$ 5 million per day according to Wall Street Journal calculatations, if it does not comply with demands set by the European Commission. The commission investigated Microsoft's practice of bundling the Windows Media Player software into the Windows operating system in 2003-2004, a practice which rivals complained was destroying the market for their own products. The "Wall Street Journal" reported Monday a week ago that the European Commission would decide their course of action in two weeks time.
Negotiations between Microsoft and the Commission broke down in March 2004 and the company was subsequently fined a record €497 million (US$ 613 million) for its breaches of EU competition law.
The ruling is subject to appeal, but a European Court decided in Dec 2004 that fines imposed on Microsoft by the EU would not be delayed. Microsoft paid the €497 million fine and must now ship versions of Windows without Windows Media Player. It was also decided by the EU court that Microsoft must license many of the protocols used in its products to developers in countries within the European Economic Area.
The European Commission rejected today a proposal by Microsoft to license its workgroup server software protocols. These protocols would allow programmers to build server programs that are compatible with systems and PCs running the Windows operating system. Influencing the decision were complaints from the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSF Europe), which said the per-server licensing proposal violated the principle that the protocols could be used to develop free software, because there is no way of knowing how many servers will be using free software.
"Microsoft either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand the idea of free software," said FSF Europe spokesman Joachim Jakobs. 
Jakobs explained that as free software is freely distributed, it is impossible to predict the extent of its use. Also, authors of free software would encounter copyright issues with Microsoft when using the protocols to distribute their software. Microsoft stated last Friday that it is still trying to find the balance between the need to preserve the private interests of Microsoft and the public interests.
Earlier, the European Commission rejected Microsoft's proposal to release the new Windows Media Player-free version of Windows under the name "Reduced Media Edition." Microsoft is now investigating other names suggested by the Commission. It is still unclear whether a deadline is or will be set for the demands by the EU.

Portal and search company Yahoo! has purchased Ludicorp Research and Development Ltd., the private corporation which owns the photo sharing site Flickr.
The news was officially disclosed in a Sunday posting to the corporation's staff blog and is credited to Caterina Fake, Flickr's vice president of marketing and community. The posting announced the sale, but did not disclose details of the deal. In a report by Silicon.Com, Yahoo! spokeswoman Joanna Stevens confirmed the deal on Sunday but also did not disclose the terms. 
Both Fake and Stevens said Flickr will remain independent. Stevens added that Flickr's employees will relocate to the Yahoo! headquarters in Sunnyvale, California later this year.
Rumors of the sale have been circulating amongst bloggers for some time, though neither company would confirm or deny the rumored sale. Other rumors had Google or AOL as Flickr's probable suitor.
Flickr allows users to upload pictures from their computers, digital cameras, or camera phones to a personal website where they can display them, engage in photo blogging and create photo albums. The graphics may be licensed under a variety copyright license schemes including public domain, and photo owners can be easily contacted through the website.

Possible black hole created in US

US particle physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York have created a fireball in a particle accelerator that bears a striking similarity to a black hole. It was generated at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by smashing beams of gold nuclei together at almost the speed of light. 
The collision produces a ball of plasma which is about 300 million times hotter that the surface of the Sun. The fireball can be detected because it absorbs jets of particles produced by the collision, but in this case 10 times as many jets were being absorbed as had been predicted by calculations. 
Physicist Horatiu Nastase of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island says that the calculations show that the fireball has properties similar to that of a black hole. Nastase says this could help explain why so few jets are seen coming out of the fireball. He thinks the particles are being absorbed into the core and reappearing as thermal (Hawking) radiation, just like theory predicts happens in a black hole. 
Other physicists have pointed out possible holes in Nastase’s calculations. Carlos Nunez of MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts said, “I wouldn’t say his model is wrong, but it’s clearly under construction.”
Even if Nastase turns out to be right, the black holes created pose no danger. At this scale gravity is not the dominant force in a black hole and they quickly evaporate away - this one lasted a mere 10-23 seconds, that is 10 million, billion, billionths of a second.

U.S. jury deliberates immigrant smuggler case

A Houston jury resumes deliberations today in a federal smuggling case where 19 illegal immigrants died from heat and lack of oxygen. The defendant, Tyrone Williams, 34, could face the death penalty for his alleged involvement in harboring and transporting illegal immigrants across the US-Mexican border.
He was reportedly paid $7,500 to bring the immigrants to Houston in a tractor trailer truck.
Williams, a Jamaican citizen, was a member of a smuggling ring. He alone faces capital punishment charges, while 14 other ring members were charged with less serious offenses for their involvement in the case. Williams allegedly made a four-hour trip across the border and then parked at a truck stop in Victoria, about 100 miles from Houston. He left the truck while 75 persons suffered in the cargo area of the trailer during sweltering heat.
The prosecution claims he abandoned the trailer while ignoring screams for help and banging on the walls from those inside the trailer.
His defense attorneys argue Williams was unable to hear anything from the trailer, and they further say greed by other ring members was the cause of the deaths since the trailer was so overcrowded. Williams should not be singled out, his attorneys maintained, just because he was the driver of the truck.
"He didn't care," said federal prosecutor Daniel Rodriguez during closing arguments. "To him, these weren't people, they were merchandise."
The jury asked U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore three questions before the trial was adjourned for the weekend.

Bank of Ireland to axe 2,000 jobs

It emerged last night that the Bank of Ireland, Ireland's second largest bank, intends to lay off 15% of its workforce. Such a move would affect 2,000 of the bank's 12,000 employees. The job cuts would be an effort to reduce the banks large cost base and thus improve its overall competitiveness.
Newly appointed CEO Brian Goggin, who took over from Michael Soden at the end of last year, suggested at the time of his appointment that one of his first moves would be to cut costs. This objective is likely to be fulfilled on Tuesday when the company makes a formal announcement about the cuts. The relative contributions of staff versus technology to the Bank's cost versus revenue base is unclear from the announcement, begging questions as to the rationale for such changes. 
The Irish banking sector - one of the world's most profitable - has experienced a dramatic change in the last few months. Danske bank, one of Denmark's leading banks recently announced the purchase of National Irish Bank. The Bank of Scotland also recently announced its entry into the Irish retail banking sector by purchasing the ESB chain of retail units for €120m. Both banks have said they intend to introduce significantly cheaper products to the market over the next twelve months.

Kyrgyz president orders election probe as protesters seize control of second city

Thousands of protesters seized control of a second city in Kyrgyzstan as President Askar Akayev ordered a probe into allegations that the elections were seriously flawed on Monday.
“The south of the country is under the control of the people. Now we should concentrate on [the capital of] Bishkek,” said former ambassador to Britain and opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva to "The Times". “We have only one demand — that Akayev should resign.”
President Akayev ordered the Central Election Commission and Supreme Court to begin an investigation into allegations that sparked the protests. According to his office, he ordered them "to pay particular attention to those districts where election results provoked extreme public reaction ... and tell people openly who is right and who is wrong."
About 1,000 protesters armed with flammable liquid and clubs seized the governor's building in Osh, Kyrgyzstan's second-largest city. The crowd of protesters, which swelled to 2,000, then seized the regional police and security stations of the city located 300 kilometres south of Bishkek.
"This is a new day in our history," said an opposition official named Omurbek Tekebayev. He also said the opposition would hold elections for alternative executive bodies throughout the country, and that they plan to call the presidential election, which is scheduled for October of 2005, within three months.
According to Tekebayev, the deputy regional police chief has joined the opposition and will be in charge of police under the new regional government.
Elsewhere in the country, at least 17,000 people continued to protest the alleged electoral fraud.
Protesters also seized control of the southern city of Jalal-Abad on Sunday.

Noted stamp engraver Czeslaw Slania dies at 83

STOCKHOLM, Sweden. 21 March 2005
The Swedish Post Office announced the famous stamp engraver, Czeslaw Słania, died in the night of Thursday, 17 March.
Born in Czeladź, Poland in October 1921, he was trained at the Kraków School of Fine Arts from 1945. While still a student, he was hired by Poland's printing bureau and began a career as an engraver, producing his first postage stamp for Poland in 1951.
In 1956 Słania moved to Sweden, where three years later he began work for the Swedish Post Office and became their chief engraver. He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries. His work is of such recognized quality and detail that he is one of the very few "household names" among philatelists. Some specialize in collecting his work alone. His 1,000th stamp was the magnificent "Great Deeds by Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in 2000, which is listed in the "Guinness Book of World Records". He was also engaged in engraving banknotes for many countries, recent examples of his work including the Prime Ministerial portraits on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 bills.
Słania was active until the end of his life, delivering his last completed stamp that commemorated the 60th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly, in February 2005.

Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronauts. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.
The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.
The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .
Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.
Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.
The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.
Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

The European Space Agency (ESA) Council approved a cooperation agreement on March 17 between the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the ESA for India's Chandrayan-1 moon satellite mission. The Chandrayan-1 will be India's first moon mission attempt.
Europe will, under the agreement, provide and support three instruments for the lunar explorer: CIXS-2, Chandrayan-1 Imaging X-Ray Spectrometer; SARA; a Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer, and SIR-2, a Near-Infrared Spectrometer. Europe will support hardware for the HEX, High-Energy X-ray Spectrometer. Data from these instruments will be turned over to the ESA for distribution to ESA member states. These instruments are the same as the ones carried onboard ESA's SMART-1 moon exploration spacecraft.
ISRO plans to launch the half-ton Chandrayan sometime before 2008 for a two year mission to study the solar system and the Moon. The satellite will be boosted by India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
The ISRO has been placing satellites in Earth orbit since 1975 and has developed its own launch vehicles and satellites for telecommunications and weather forecasting. A manned mission had been previously considered but was deemed too costly to carry through.

Lasica and Canter have been working on the site with a cadre of volunteers since they met at a Supernova conference 9 months ago, according to Lasica's blog. The site was started in the summer of 2004, and announced its official launch on March 21, 2005.
While the server initially hosting Ourmedia was not able to handle the load imposed when publicised on tech news sites such as Slashdot and BoingBoing (reported by ITConversations, among others), it has now been replaced and improved. According to a post on the Ourmedia blog, "The transition to a new dedicated server has been completed, the database configuration has been given an overhaul, and some of the code has been cleaned up."
The software running Ourmedia is an open source content management system called Bryght, described at Bryght.com as "the Drupal core set of modules plus a set of contributed Drupal modules." Ourmedia describes their system as being "alpha" quality; they note that because all of the media files on their site are being hosted by the Internet Archive, users will need to register with both sites with the same username and password until the registration systems are unified.

Surfwax releases &quot;quick index&quot; to 600k Wikipedia terms

Surfwax, Inc., a metasearch engine and knowledge-tool provider announced its release of Wikiwax, a new portal for searching Wikipedia article titles. This is the latest addition to its offerings of narrowly focused search portals, such as its News Accumulator and ShopEasier shopping portal.
Wikiwax claims to index over 600,000 Wikipedia terms, and its list of titles was last updated sometime in March, 2005. Once you enter terms into the search field, a menu of matching titles is shown; selecting one of the titles takes you directly to its Wikipedia entry.
Wikiwax uses a Surfwax feature called "LookAhead" to suggest auto-completions of search terms as a user types them. It matches both articles whose titles start with the search terms, and articles containing those terms in that order. For example, a search for "Wales, Jimmy" would find the article "Jimmy Wales". A search for "The Earth" would also match "The Earth Stood Still, The Day". Surfwax offered visitors this manner of "LookAhead" auto-complete searching for over a year.
Other Surfwax projects include Nextaris, an all-in-one "information exchange" portal offering searching/uploading/sharing/publishing/social-networking, and search packages targeted to specific industries, such as the Surfwax Scholar portal offered to educational institutions.

U.S. TV networks look to past for future programming

 Four of six national television broadcast networks recently wooed potential advertisers for the 2005-2006 season with programming offerings in the new development phase. These included NBC, Fox, and The WB. Two other networks, CBS and UPN, plan to preview their offerings March 24.
After four years of focusing on high-profile reality television, network executives are turning to the past for inspiration on scripted series. Some networks said they are "more consciously aggressive about developing shows" that recall such classics as "Taxi" and "Barney Miller", Craig Erwich, a programming executive for Fox, told "USA Today". In the same report, Kevin Reilly, NBC entertainment chief said, "I don't think the answer has to be that it's groundbreaking or something you've never seen before." 
But at least one ad buyer had reservations about the rear-view mirror technique. "Every network seems to be looking back rather than forward for programming ideas. The reminiscence factor may be good if you are looking for an older audience, but it may not be a way to bring in the younger audiences," Laura Caraccioli-Davis, senior vice president and director of Starcom Entertainment told "Mediaweek" magazine.

Ten dead on Minnesota Indian reservation after school shooting

A 17-year-old Minnesota student is believed to have shot his grandfather and grandmother, drove his grandfather's squad car to the high school, and shot a security guard, a teacher and five other classmates, later committing suicide. This happened at 3pm local time on Monday (2100 UTC), and as many as 14 others were injured before the rampage subsided.
One witness said of the gunman, he was "grinning and waving".
"I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that's when I hid," Sondra Hegstrom told "The Pioneer of Bemidji". "You could hear a girl saying, 'No, Jeff, quit, quit. Leave me alone. What are you doing?"
Today's incident marks the highest death toll yet in US school shootings since the Columbine High School massacre in April 1999. There were 15 people shot in Jefferson County, near Littleton, Colorado, in the Columbine shooting.
Police are still investigating any possible motive.
"It will probably take us throughout the night to really put the whole picture together," said FBI spokesman Paul McCabe in a briefing to the press. "We do have evidence that we believe that the shooter is dead," he continued, "we believe he was acting alone."
Reporters were asked to leave the area, located on The Red Lake reservation, by tribal authorities.
"The events that took place today involving the shootings at the Red Lake High School make this one of the darkest and most painful occurrences in the history of our tribe," said Floyd Jourdain Jr., Chairman of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians. The Indian band is made up of about 5,100 people, living on 825,000 acres of land in the northern part of the state.
Minnesota's last school shooting was in September 2003, when two students were fatally shot at Rocori High School. That incident had statewide implications, causing a hearing on expansion of tribal gaming in Minnesota to be canceled for the day.
"We ask Minnesotans to help comfort the families and friends of the victims who are suffering unimaginable pain by extending prayers and expressions of support," said a statement from Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.

Romanian Commercial Bank to launch smart cards in early April

Starting from April 4, the Romanian Commercial Bank ("Banca Comercială Română", or BCR), the country's largest bank, will launch a smart card system for all its ATM network as well as its point-of-sale terminals in more than 5,000 stores across Romania. While the system will be enabled to work with these cards from April, the smart cards themselves will only be issued to account holders in the second half of the year.
Smart cards in a banking context are cards which contain information on a chip and can permit greater security and control of transactions. BCR is the first Romanian bank to use this technology.

Romanian Visa card transactions increase by 60 percent in 2004

Total Romanian Visa card transactions rose by 60% in 2004 in comparison to 2003.
They reached a value of US$2.8 billion. This was due to a 30% increase in the number of cards issued, as well as greater spending by Romanians. The results are based on both ATM transactions and purchases in various stores.
According to Visa, purchases with Visa cards almost doubled to $164.4 million. The number of people in Romania who pay with Visa cards rose by 130%, reaching 3.3 million customers. The most popular cards were Visa Gold, with nearly 800,000 cards issued in 2004, and Visa Electron, with more than 600,000 cards issued.
Visa cards are an increasingly popular way of consumer spending in Romania and, by the end of 2004, they were accepted at 15,727 locations across the country, an increase of 17.7% in comparison to 2003.

Romanian mobile telephony giant Connex, recently bought by Vodafone, announced the company is planning to introduce 3G services and video telephony. Romanian cities effected by the change are: Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timişoara, Braşov, Constanţa, Ploieşti, Craiova and Iaşi. The only 3G-enabled model currently sold by Connex is the Nokia 6630.
Ken Campbell, chief marketing officer of Connex, said he expects the 3G introduction to be successful, given the Romanian interest in video telephony services. Connex's 3G technology will also provide a permanent connection to the Internet, access to multimedia content, live video streaming and video conferencing. The network also provides mobile broadband speeds of up to 384 kbps.
Connex is currently the second-largest mobile telephony company in Romania, with nearly five million customers. It is one of Romanian's best recognised companies.

The Romanian defence minister Teodor Atanasiu will start a two-day tour of Bulgaria today by visiting the country's main air-force base at Graf Ignatievo. Atanasiu will meet with Bulgarian prime minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha and defence minister Nikolay Svinarov. The theme of the visit is the deepening of bilaterial military co-operation between the two neighbouring countries.
Romania and Bulgaria both joined NATO in 2004. They are also expected to host US military bases in the near future as the USA wishes to move its European troops from Germany into Southeastern Europe. The deepening of military ties between the countries is expected to increase their strategic military position in the world. Both Romania and Bulgaria were major participants in the US-led invasion of Iraq and the resulting peacekeeping efforts. Romania currently supplies one of the world's largest contingents of troops in Iraq, with nearly 1000 people.

Internet through electrical power network introduced in Bucharest

Between 10 to 15 of Bucharest's 61 Unirii Boulevard residents will be able to connect to the Internet through their power lines. Starting from May of this year, a trial was organised by Electrica Muntenia Sud, the electricity company of Bucharest and Southern Romania.
The technology, known as Power Line Communications (PLC), enables the transmission of broadband Internet and fixed line telephony data through the existing electrical power network. The technology, in use by 13,000 people in 30 countries throughout the world, is considered very advantageous due to its high speeds and low cost. It uses infrastructure that is already available in most people's homes.
Once the Unirii Boulevard trial concludes, and if it is successful, Electrica Muntenia Sud will roll-out the PLC Internet plan to the mass market. It is expected to be embraced by Romanians because its data transfer speed of 5Mps is available for a monthly subscription fee of less than 15 euro.
Bucharest is the first city in Southeastern Europe to trial such innovative technology.

EU looks set to continue arms embargo on China

The EU is likely to delay the end of its arms embargo on China until next year, European diplomats said. The delay is a response to legislation passed in China earlier this month, authorising the use of military force against Taiwan if it attempts to officially secede from the mainland.
The EU came under intense pressure from the United States to not lift the embargo imposed after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, when the Chinese government suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators. The US Congress threatened that it would retaliate against the EU if it lifted the arms embargo, by blocking the approval of technology transfer licenses.
The EU has made clear the delay is only temporary, and their commitment from last December to lift the embargo still stood.
European Commission spokeswoman Emma Udwin added, "The timescale is completely open, no deadline. [The] Luxembourg presidency said in January that they wanted to lift the embargo within their presidency, but there is no obligation to do that."
China defended its anti-secession law and responded to the ban by saying, "The EU ban on arms sales to China is political discrimination against China and out of keeping with the times," Liu Jianchao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news conference.
"We hope the EU will make the political decision to lift the ban as soon as possible," Liu continued. "It's unreasonable to link China pushing the EU to lift the arms embargo and China passing the anti-secession law," he said.
On Sunday, British foreign secretary Jack Straw in a British television interview commented that lifting the arms embargo was "more difficult rather than less difficult," and that China's anti-secession law towards Taiwan created "a difficult political environment."
However, diplomats have told "Le Monde" that the UK was lobbying for a push-back of the decision to 2006, particularly among various EU countries more focuses on human rights issues.
The UK continues to support ending the embargo in principle, and Prime Minister Blair has envisioned a successful decision by the summer. While Britain is sensitive to American pressure, it nonetheless wants to assure a positive road leading up to its assuming of EU presidency duties on July 1.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice characterized Mr. Straw's remarks as "sobering comments" during her stay in Beijing on Monday.
"After all, it is American forces here in the Pacific that have played the role of security guarantor," she said.

Texas baby removed from life support against mother's wishes

Sun Hudson, a six-month old Texas baby died last week when health care providers at Texas Children's Hospital in removed his life support system over the objections of his mother. The action was authorized under the 1999 Futile Care Law which was signed into law by then-Gov. George W. Bush.
Under the Texas Futile Care Law, health care workers are allowed to remove expensive life support for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills.
Sun Hudson's mother is dealing with the aftermath of that law. "This hospital was considered a miracle hospital. When it came to my son, they gave up in six months," Wanda Hudson told reporters how she was forced to give up medical control of her son. "I talked to him, I told him that I loved him. Inside of me, my son is still alive." 
The hospital had blocked the media from the child, despite mother's invitation to see the baby. "I wanted y'all to see my son for yourself. So you could see he was actually moving around. He was conscious," she said.
The event stirred national attention as it sparked comparisons to the Terri Schiavo case in Florida. A victim of severe, and otherwise terminal brain damage, Terri Schiavo's future is locked in a legal battle between her husband who wants to remove life support and her parents, who cite religious reasons for keeping their daughter alive.
Michael Schiavo, husband of Terri Schiavo, was asked about the Hudson situation on the March 21 edition of CNN's "Larry King Live." When King asked how Mr. Schiavo felt when he learned that President Bush had signed such a law in Texas while he was governor, Schiavo was at a loss of words.
But Schiavo's lawyer did respond, saying, "Obviously, there's a tremendous amount of hypocrisy there ... it would lead one to believe that a lot of this was politically motivated, and I think that's what the American people have concluded." Schiavo's lawyer echoed the sentiments of Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat, who raised the "hypocrisy" question when she first mentioned the 1999 Texas law issue on the House floor last week.
Over the weekend, President Bush signed a special federal law that moved jurisdiction of the Schiavo case out of the state of Florida and into the U.S. federal court system after Florida courts ruled that Michael Schiavo had the right to remove Terri's life support, which includes a feeding tube and intravenous liquids.
After signing the Schiavo Law Sunday, President Bush said, "It is wisest to always err on the side of life."

Large creature loose in London suburb

Police organized a search in the Sydenham Park area of south-east London after a local, Anthony Holder, was attacked by a 6ft long black animal while looking for his kitten in his back yard that borders a woodland.
Holder said the animal pounced, knocked him to the ground, and then he was "in its claws for about 30 seconds. Its teeth were out and I tried to defend myself and eventually I got the thing off my body." Holder was scratched all over his body and suffered swelling and bruising to his hand and the back of his head. He called the police at about 2:15 am while the animal sat in the garden next door.
While Holder was being treated by paramedics, the Metropolitan Police conducted a search of the area. A citizen and a police officer saw the creature, believed by some to be a panther. Another officer also believed he saw the animal and reports it as approximately the size of a Labrador Retriever. The neighbourhood is being patrolled by an armed police response vehicle staffed by officers equipped with rifles and Taser stun guns.
Scotland Yard is currently seeking specialist advice from experts from the RSPCA and London Zoo. A spokeswoman said: "We are trying to establish exactly where the animal may have come from. In the meantime we are asking the public to be vigilant. If anyone does see the animal, do not approach it but dial 9-9-9 immediately." 
People are also being advised to keep pets indoors.
Sightings of big cats have increased in recent years. The notion of a large predator in London was initially dismissed by scientists, but evidence from footprints and droppings has led to other conclusions. The British Big Cat Society estimates 50 to 100 are currently loose across England. Livestock has supposedly been attacked a number of times. Farmers near Burford in Oxfordshire have offered a £5,000 reward for the capture of a large black creature suspected of killing livestock in the area. However, there have been virtually no human encounters.

Creationist sentiments affect Imax business strategy

Imax cinemas in several southern US states have begun to refuse screening of films that deal with evolution and the big bang, fearing they will drive away customers. This step follows pressure from customers claiming such films are blasphemous to the Christian religion and are counter to biblical teachings which fundamentalists take to be the literal word of God.
Some of the affected cinemas are located in science museums often visited by families. Carol Murray, the marketing director of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History in Texas, commented that trial customers complained, "I really hate it when the theory of evolution is presented as fact," a view reflected by several others. Conversely, a producer of an Imax film entitled "Volcanoes of the Deep Sea", James Cameron, said that he was "surprised and somewhat offended" at some of the reactions.
Films suppressed by this controversy include "Cosmic Voyage" (which deals with the big bang), "Galapagos" (dealing with the development of evolutionary theory by Darwin) and "Volcanoes of the Deep Sea" (about deep-sea thermophiles).
Although this move only affects about a dozen Southern US cinemas, it has proved significant due to the manner in which Imax operates. Imax presentations are filmed and projected using specialized equipment in specially adapted theatres. Imax films also have tight production and marketing budgets. At any one time, an Imax film may be shown at only two dozen locations. As such, profits may be significantly reduced if just a few locations refuse to show a given film, swaying producers to avoid producing films on contentious subjects which may be construed by Christian fundamentalists as blasphemous.

US interest rates rise to 2.75%

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) today raised interest rates by 0.25 of a percentage point to 2.75 percent. The increase in the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, is seen as an anti-inflationary measure and was widely expected by the financial community.
It is the seventh time the Fed has raised interest rates since June 2004 when rates stood at just 1 percent -- a 46-year low.
The U.S. economy has been gaining strength since the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002. The rebound was largely fueled by historically low interest rates which enabled consumers to borrow much more money than they would have otherwise -- thus boosting personal consumption.

Twenty-four cars of a west-bound Canada Pacific train were thrown from the tracks after the train collided with a semi tractor-trailer in poor weather and visibility near Regina, Saskatchewan around 11 a.m. Tuesday morning. The driver was rushed to hospital.
The accident took place on a level section of Highway 46 just north of Highway 1, about 25 kilometres east of Regina. The RCMP spokesperson reported the crossing is marked with lights, but weather may have played a role.
"Road conditions were wet and sloppy and it's foggy," RCMP Cpl. Brian Jones said to the CBC. The bad weather, including a heavy overnight snowfall, may have contributed to the accident.
Most of the 93 cars in the train were empty bulk transit cars, used for moving agricultural products such as grains. The RCMP report that neither train or truck were transporting any hazardous materials.

Kyrgyz authorities declared 71 of the 75 seats elected to parliament valid on Tuesday as the opposition cemented control and attempted to maintain order of the country's south, including the cities of Jalal-Abad and Osh, by holding joint patrols with local policeman.
President Askar Akayev, saying protests against him were part of an attempted coup, claimed "criminal elements connected to the drug mafia" were behind the activities, and "the opposition is directed and funded from outside."
However, the president ruled out declaring a state of emergency, saying he was "fully committed to not taking such measures."
Bazambai Solpuyev, a leader of the opposition, claimed that joint public safety patrols has been set up with local police, and this claim was confimed by a spokesman for the Kyrgyz interior ministry.
Anvar Artykov, head of the opposition-backed Osh provisional authority, declared that president Akayev’s authority was no longer being recognized in the region in a statement broadcast on a local television station. 
Prominent opposition figure Roza Otunbayeva claimed that "people’s power" provisional authorities controlled five of the eight districts of Jalal-Abad Province, all but one district of Osh Province, four districts in Talas Province, and one in Naryn.
Law-enforcement bodies in the regions have transferred their allegiance to the provisional authorities, although some policemen were not reporting for work. According to reports, relative calm prevailed throughout opposition-controlled regions.
"We are moving towards control over half the country," Otunbayeva said. "The next goal will be [the capital of] Bishkek."

NASA's Spitzer space telescope views alien worlds

For the first time since the discovery of planets outside the solar system, light from two of the 145 confirmed extrasolar planets has been directly captured by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.
Astronomers Dr. David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Dr. Drake Deming of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), working separately on one each of the two planets used a simple technique to gather the infrared glow that the planetary bodies emit.
The planets, designated HD 209458b and TrES-1, are classified as "hot Jupiter" planets. These types of extrasolar planets orbit closely around their suns, absorbing the starlight and brightly radiating in the infrared wavelengths.
Using the Spitzer telescope, the astronomers first collected and measured the total infrared output from both the stars and planets. The stars alone were again measured when the planets disappeared behind them during their natural orbits. By comparing the differences between the two measurements, the scientist were able to determine how much infrared light each planet emits.
"In visible light, the glare of the star completely overwhelms the glimmer of light reflected by the planet," Charbonneau said. "In infrared, the star-planet contrast is more favorable because the planet emits its own light."
The data obtained indicates the planets are at least 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit, justifying the classification of "hot Jupiter". More observations from Spitzer could provide information about the planets winds and atmospheric compositions.
"Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth," said Dr. Deming.
"It's fantastic," Dr. Charbonneau said. "We've been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered."
Dr. Deming's paper on his findings appears today in Nature's online publication; Dr. Charbonneau's paper will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal.
The Spitzer telescope was launched August 25, 2003 and is scheduled to be de-orbited sometime in 2008. Spitzer was named for Dr. Lyman Spitzer who, in the mid-1940s, first proposed placing telescopes in space.
The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The Goddard Space Flight Center is located in Greenbelt, Maryland.

In an overwhelming vote, the Icelandic parliament voted Tuesday to grant the incarcerated Bobby Fischer full citizenship. The former world chess champion has been detained in Japan since July after being arrested for attempting to travel with a revoked United States passport. Japanese officials have previously said that in such a case Fischer would be sent to Iceland rather than face punishment for violating US economic sanctions by playing a match in Yugoslavia. The US has said it will oppose any such action.
The vote earlier today was 40 in favor, 2 abstentions, 21 absent, and 0 opposed. By a special variation from usual protocol, the measure was pushed through in only 12 minutes. The parliament had earlier declined to grant Fischer full citizenship, offering him instead a special Icelandic passport. This, however, was not enough for Japan, which refused to release him. 
Fischer's case has been long and convoluted. Originally pursued by the US for economic sanction violations, Fischer has been on the run since 1992. In that time he has shown his anti-Semitism by having issued statements praising the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and denying that the Holocaust occurred. For these and other comments the United States Chess Federation revoked his membership. He is now also wanted for tax evasion on some property he owns in the US. He was arrested in Japan in July for travelling with a revoked passport, and has been held since then awaiting deportation. In that time he has tried to avoid being deported by doing such things as revoking his US citizenship and marrying a Japanese woman.

Australian Govt to lessen numbers of immigrants detained indefinitely

The Australian Government today announced terms of a new class of visa which is aimed at reducing the number of immigration detainees locked up indefinitely, after years of criticism by human rights watchdogs.
The new Return Pending Bridging Visa allows for release of detainees held for over three years and who have exhausted all rights for appeal, but who cannot be removed from Australia. In the community they will be provided income support, Medicare, maternity and child benefits, rent assistance and permission to work, and will be required to periodically report to authorities.
Senator Amanda Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs said, "The new Bridging visa will only be granted to a relatively small number of detainees where ... it is not reasonably practicable to achieve removal in the short term and where the detainee undertakes to cooperate fully with removal from Australia, once that becomes practicable."
"The new bridging visa will not be available to detainees with current visa applications, or who are challenging decisions, either through review or courts," the Minister said.
"The new bridging visa category does not apply to failed asylum seekers on Nauru. Management of that caseload remains completely separate from onshore cases." 
And the visa applies only at the Minister's discretion.
A recent High Court decision has left it in the Government's hands to resolve the issue of indefinite detention, maintaining that under the law there was nothing to prevent immigrants who could not be sent to another country and are not accepted by the Australian Government, from being imprisoned forever.
The change is thought to allow release of up to 100 detainees currently held, although it is not a blanket release for all detainees held over three years, for example the longest-serving detainee, Peter Qasim who has been held for seven years, will not be eligible.
Ms Vanstone claims Mr Qasim has not co-operated with the department's attempts to establish his identity. India will only take him if it can be proven that he is Indian - and without any evidence available except his language, he has been unable to return. But according to Ms Vanstone, all it requires is "further co-operation from Mr Qasim" - therefore he remains in detention.
Qasim wrote in an open letter in September: “I have asked 80 countries to take me but all have refused. I have committed no crime but I have a life sentence. Please give me freedom. I would work hard with a grateful heart. But I cannot live imprisoned forever without hope.”

Minuteman bike path iced out through Arlington after 4th snowiest winter on record

The Minuteman bike path, which runs 12 miles from Cambridge to Bedford, Massachusetts, is now passable by bike through Arlington, after what the National Weather Service has called the fourth snowiest winter in Boston's recorded history. The path has been covered in snow and ice since the Blizzard of 2005 covered it in late January.
The stretch of the path that crosses Lexington and Bedford is marginally rideable, particularly between Lexington Center and the bridge over Route 495, according to a sortie undertaken by Wikinews writer . The first large patch of snow occurs just past the four-mile marker, near Trader Joe's in Arlington.
The path is not plowed in Arlington, Lexington, or Bedford, though the city of Cambridge plows a short section near the southeastern terminus of the path at the Alewife subway station. In the winter, the path can be a "scenic trail for cross-country skiing," according to the Friends of the Minuteman Bikeway website.
The bike path runs in the right-of-way once accorded to the Boston and Maine railroad. The conversion from abandoned railway to bike path occurred from 1991 to 1993. The path is named for its similarity to the route followed by Paul Revere and William Dawes on their rides to warn the Minutemen of Lexington about the impending arrival of British soldiers on April 19, 1775.

AU$1.25M reward offer for proof of living Tasmanian Tiger (Thylacine)

Australian magazine "" has offered a reward of AU$1.25 million for conclusive proof that the legendary , is still alive.
Says The Bulletin, "A live, uninjured animal must be produced. All government regulations and provisions must be adhered to. A panel of eminent experts chosen by us will have the final say - along with conclusive DNA testing."
Although the last confirmed wild Thylacine sighting was in 1932, and the last captive, named Benjamin, died in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart on September 6, 1936, the legend has lived on, with occasional claimed sightings both in Tasmania, and on mainland Australia.
As recently as February of this year, a German tourist claimed to have taken photographs of the creature near Lake St Clair in Tasmania. According to The Bulletin, over the past 70 years there have been more than 4000 claimed sightings, but not a single verifiable artifact of hard evidence.
Appearing like a large, striped dog, the thylacine was in fact a marsupial, with a pouch like a kangaroo or koala. Present on the Australian continent for tens of thousands of years, persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums saw the remnant Tasmanian population wiped out.
Nick Mooney, a wildlife biologist with the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment, investigates 150 claims of sightings each year. He told The Bulletin he was open-minded to the possibility of the thylacine's survival, "But if I had to make a call, I'd put money on them not being out there."
The reward offer marks the 125th year of publication of The Bulletin magazine.

Google launches Google Code project, showcasing open source code, APIs

On Thursday, March 17, Google announced the launch of code.google.com, a new website for its open-source software (also known as "code") and APIs, for use by external developers. This launch is the first significant contribution Google has made to the open-source community. The release was announced at the end of the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference in San Diego.
Google's announcement comes two weeks after Yahoo announced its own Developers Program, offering access to a new collection of its APIs, at the Search Engine Strategies 2005 Conference &amp; Expo in New York. Chris DiBona, Google's Open Source Program Manager, spoke about the release, emphasizing their desire to feature good programs that were being developed using their APIs. Two XML feeds are currently offered on the site, one for general updates to code hosted there, and another for changes to the weekly featured content.
The initial software projects provided on the Google site are narrowly focused, consisting of tools for debugging and compiling in two computer languages, C++ and Python, particularly when handling multi-threaded code. Google says this is in part to get feedback from a particular audience, before expanding the scope of the project.
These tools are all available under the BSD open-source license, though the site's FAQ notes that it is not tied to any particular license, and in the future is likely to include code released under a variety of free licenses. Google has said that it is developing this site, in part, in the hopes that it can use some of the resulting code in the future.

Symbian licenses email technology from rival Microsoft

Mobile phone operating software maker Symbian is licensing the Microsoft ActiveSync technology in a move that surprised analysts. The license would allow Symbian to develop a plug-in for mobile phones to let users check email that is served by Microsoft Exchange Server mail system.
Symbian was formed in 1998 by Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola and Psion in a collaborative desire to counter Microsoft's emerging market power in operating systems for handheld devices. While Microsoft now provides the Windows Mobile software for mobile phones, it has not attained significant market penetration. At the same time, in part through the increased popularity of Research in Motion's "BlackBerry" mobile email device, users have come to expect their mobile phones to synchronize email with various mail servers — including Exchange Server.
Symbian appears to be sensitive to the appearance of collaborating with the very competitor that spurred their creation. Symbian's press release emphasized that the licensing of the technology introduces just one of the many methods the Symbian software communicates with email servers. The spokesperson for the company, Peter Bancroft, was also on the defensive: "Microsoft isn't a monolithic company" he said, referring to the fact that Exchange Server and Windows Mobile are created by two different divisions of Microsoft.
Shares of Research in Motion dropped on the news.

Three people are dead and five are injured after an explosion tore through a shopping center near the port of Jounie, 20 kilometres north of Beirut, Lebanon. The 45-pound bomb, which was placed under a stairwell, exploded around 1:30am local time (0330 UTC).
Police say they believe the bomb was placed there just before the center closed.
The blast caused serious damage to the shopping center, breaking windows, causing false ceilings to collapse, and pillars to warp within a radius of several hundred meters.

India signs on to chemical patents to comply with WTO order

A bill passed by India's Parliament put an end to the manufacture of many cheap generic drugs copied from products protected by foreign company patents. A Patents Amendment Bill (2005) has been condemned by foreign aid groups who expect a significant rise in drug costs as a result of the bill.
Drug compounds in India were previously not protected by patents, meaning that research and developement costs borne by the originating manufacturers were avoided by generic drug producers. The new bill "will move India toward the patent mainstream and support and encourage innovation and investment in research and development in India," said Ranjit Sahani, managing director of Novartis India.
As the world's fourth-largest manufacturer of drugs by volume, the pharmaceutical industry in India is valued at US$5 billion - but ranks as only 13th by value, reflecting the low costs to consumers of the products. "Because India is one of the world's biggest producers of generic drugs, this law will have a severe knock-on effect on many developing countries which depend on imported generic drugs from India," said Samar Verma, regional policy adviser at Oxfam International.
Around half of African, Asian and Latin American HIV patients needing anti-retroviral drugs rely on low-cost drugs from India, which are sold at one twentieth the price of similar drugs produced in the West.
More than 90 per cent of drugs listed as essentials in India are either unpatented or expired. Drugs patented before 1995 -- when the World Trade Organization [WTO] set a 10 year deadline to enact protection -- will not be eligible under the bill.
Some degree of protection was mandated by WTO in order for India to have greater access to international markets. Opposers of the bill say it goes too far. 
The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights [TRIPS], under WTO, allows developing countries to not provide patent protection for uses of known drugs, new dosages and formulations, or combinations of known drugs.

U.S. federal marshals seize killer beds

On behalf of the FDA, U.S. Federal marshals have begun seizing beds which have killed at least seven patients out of about 30 who had become trapped by the products. Three versions of the bed were found to be "dangerous to health" by the FDA, with the specific danger of, "placing patients at an increased risk of entrapment and asphyxiation."
The model numbers of the faulty beds include the "Vail 500, 1000, and 2000 Enclosed Bed Systems". The beds are made by Toledo, Ohio-based Vail Products, Inc.
In a government press release, the FDA pointed out that Vail had failed to heed two previous warnings issued by the agency, asking the company to comply with regulations regarding proper labeling and usage directions. The FDA also said that Vail had failed to supply required documentation to the agency to comply with the "Medical Device Reporting" and "Reports of Corrections and Removals" regulations.
At the time this story was filed, the Vail web site made no mention of today's FDA announcement. Toledo's "WTOL News 11" reported that, "Company officials say their beds aren't dangerous if used properly." The Vail corporate web site claims that the beds allow, "the patient to move about freely within a safe, padded environment" and "control wandering."
The FDA is the U.S. agency responsible for regulating food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics.

96 dead of Ebola-like Marburg virus in Angola

More than 100 people are dead in Uige province in northern Angola, due to a virus related to the Ebola virus, known as the Marburg virus, which causes death by bleeding and is both "very virulent" and "very contagious". A longer incubation period without symptoms than that of the Ebola virus has authorities keeping a watchful eye for the disease migrating.
"This is a possibility. The incubation period is 21 days so we must reinforce the surveillance in neighbouring provinces and especially in Luanda," Vice Minister for Health Jose Van Dunem told "Reuters".
The virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, including saliva. Most of the victims have been children under five. There is no cure, but the 70 percent survival rate is somewhat better than the worst form of Ebola, which has a survival rate of only 10 percent.
Symptoms of Marburg include high fever, headaches, nausea with vomiting, and diarrhea accompanied by blood.

Parker shown the door as Gap spokeswoman

 Sarah Jessica Parker has lost her fashion cache with The U.S. clothier said it was dropping the star of its current and ubiquitous "I Enjoy Being a Girl" television advertising campaign and buying out her contract.
Parker who turns 40 Friday and is best known for her role as the Manolo Blahnik shoe-crazed Carrie Bradshaw on the HBO comedy, "," was ousted after less than one year of a multi-year contract. She signed a three-year $38 million deal with the San Francisco-based retailer in mid-2004 and has only appeared in ads for the company since the 2004 holiday season.
"While Gap will always seek partnerships with celebrities, musicians and rising stars, we don't have any future plans to sign a single person to a multi-season deal like the unique and special relationship we enjoyed with Sarah Jessica," Gap said in a statement Monday, stopping short of calling the ad campaign a failure. One such rising star slated to appear in the upcoming summer white denim promotion for Gap is 17-year-old Grammy-nominated British singer Joss Stone. 
Although Gap would not say its Parker ad campaign was less than successful, the same can not be said for stock market pundits. "If you're like me, and have gotten a little sick of hearing Sarah Jessica Parker sing about how much she likes being a girl on those Gap commercials," Alyce Lomax, a stock market commentator for The Motley Fool web site, said. "Investors who have been watching this stock know that despite the best efforts of Ms. Parker and the creative teams that came up with the ads, Gap's quarterly fashion sense continues to be, well, flattish ... in the meantime, other, hotter retailers have stolen the show."
In a statement to reporters, Parker called the spilt with Gap a mutual decision, and walks away $38 million richer and recently signed a 2-year deal with former employer HBO to develop future programming for the network. Parker is also scheduled to appear in two upcoming comedy films, a movie adaptation of the Comedy Central series, "Strangers with Candy", as well as "The Family Stone", costarring and Claire Danes.

Chess legend avoids 10 year prison term

Former world chess champion Bobby Fischer will move from Japan to his new home of Iceland despite requests from the USA for his deportation to the US. Mr Fischer had been held in Japan since last July when he was arrested on what US officials claimed was an invalid US passport. He was freed from detention on March 23 after 9 months in confinement.
Mr Fischer is wanted in the USA for violating Executive Order 12810, signed by then-President George H. W. Bush in 1992. EO 12810 placed sanctions on the former Yugoslavia, where Mr Fischer played a chess match in 1992 against Boris Spassky. If Mr Fischer had been sent to the US, he would have faced a ten year prison term. The U.S. revoked his passport in 2003 and Mr Fischer was later arrested at Narita Airport while trying to leave Japan en route to the Philippines.
Following an appeal by Mr Fischer's supporters, the parliament of Iceland granted Mr Fischer an Icelandic passport on Monday. Mr Fischer won the world championship in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1972, against Mr Spassky, then of the Soviet Union, and Mr Fischer remains popular among Icelanders. (Mr Spassky became a French citizen in 1978). The 1992 rematch was billed as as being for the "World Championship", although by then most chess fans recognized Garry Kasparov as the world's #1 player.
Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, said that the US government had sent a message of displeasure to the Icelandic government before its parliament passed the bill allowing for Mr Fischer's citizenship. Mr Oskarsson went on to say that, "Despite the message, the decision was put through Parliament on humanitarian grounds".

Kazaa Trial concluding

The trial against internet file-sharing network Kazaa in Sydney, Australia, is coming to an end, as closing arguments began today. Kazaa pleaded it could not be held responsible for the copyright infringements perpetrated by its users, as it cannot control how the software is used.
The peer-to-peer distribution software and its owner, Sharman Networks Ltd. and its directors were sued by a group of Australian record labels for copyright infringements by the network's estimated 100 million members worldwide. Members of the software share music files with each other, and download up to three billion songs and music files monthly. The music industry claims it has lost millions of dollars in unpaid royalties as a result.
Lawyer Tony Meagher argued that Sharman is no more responsible for the uses of its software than the designers of the photocopiers and video recorders were responsible for the illegal copying of materials on those machines. The remaining question is whether Kazaa authorises its users to download files illegally.
"We tell these users in our Web site and we tell them in our license that they cannot use this (software) for infringing copyright," Meagher told Judge Murray Wilcox. By consenting to this license by users, Kazaa is exempted from responsibility.
The record industry claims Kazaa not only enables but encourages copyright infringement. Record industry lawyer Tony Bannon argued that as Kazaa collected information from its users through spyware and sold it to advertisers, the company's claim that it had no control over the software was "completely mind boggling."
This is not the first trial against Kazaa, and other programs of its kind. In August last year, Judge Stephen Wilson ruled that the distribution by Grokster and Morpheus of peer-to-peer software does not violate U.S. copyright law. Rod Dorman, lead trial council for Sharman Networks in the U.S., said, "As a result of this decision, Sharman Networks will be filing a motion for summary judgement, nearly identical to the successful motions filed by Grokster and Morpheus, and we are confident that Judge Wilson will find that our product, Kazaa, is a lawful product as well." However, the ruling held no precedential effect in the Australian trial, as the principles differed.
Kazaa and the FastTrack protocol are the brainchild of the Scandinavians Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis, and were introduced in March 2001 by their Dutch company Consumer Empowerment. It appeared during the end of the first generation of P2P networks. Napster shut down in July of that year. (Wikipedia)
The trial is expected to wrap up later today. A verdict should be passed within six weeks.

New Kyrgz interior minister says force may be used, riot police clash with protesters in Bishkek

About 200 riot police violently broke up a peaceful, anti-Akayev protest of some 300 to 400 people and arrested 20 to 30 protesters in the capital city of Bishkek on Wednesday, just hours after President Askar Akayev appointed head of police in the city, Keneshbek Dushebayev, as new interior minister.
"Our primary task is to restore constitutional order in all regions," the new interior minister said. "The law gives us every right to take action, including by using physical force... and firearms."
Akayev has previously stated that he would not resort to force to end protests.
Akayev dismissed Interior Minister Bakirdin Subanbekov and the general prosecutor, Myktybek Abdyldayev, earlier in the day. According to a spokesman for Akayev, Abdil Seghizbayev, the dismissals were for issues relating "to the events in the south and their poor work on preventing those events."
Seghizbayev stated that Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev would visit the southern city of Osh for negotiations on Thursday, but said there would not be talks with "criminal groups that are controlling the situation there."
Elsewhere in Bishkek, approximately 10,000 people held a pro-government demonstration as riot police guarded key government buildings and main roads were sealed off. Several demonstrators said they had been coerced into taking part. 
"Our classes were cancelled and we were told to be here at the meeting in support of Akayev," a Kyrgyz National University student said.
"We are protesting instead of working now," said an employee of the interior ministry at the rally.
Neighboring Tajikistan also sealed border crossing points from Kyrgyzstan into the country because of the unrest.

Harp seal hunt approved by Canada, activists call for boycott of Canadian seafood

, 
Ottawa says it will allow the harvest of 320,000 young seals this year, prompting a backlash from international environmental activists who call for a boycott of the Canadian fisheries products.
The seal hunt is an annual event on the ice floes off the east coast of Canada where the seal nurseries give birth. This year's hunt begins March 29, and lasts for two months.
The government reports the harp seal population is large and healthy. "The harp seal herd - the most important seal herd for this industry - is estimated at around five million animals, nearly the highest level ever recorded, and almost triple what it was in the 1970s," a Department of Fisheries and Oceans statement said. Large scale hunts will continue to be allowed until the harp seal population drops below four million.
Environmental activists protest and observe the hunt annually, but this year's larger number of seals has brought a bigger response. Observers are already in the hunt area, and officials said if too many show up they will be prevented from interfering with the hunt. The annual protests, and the publication of photos of the hunt, are a public relations problem for Canada.
Protests were held in 50 cities around the world last week, and activists say they would press consumers and restaurants to avoid Canadian fish for at least the duration of the hunt.
"We're going to be encouraging consumers to enter into dialogue with their grocery stores and their restaurants and say 'Please don't serve Canadian seafood' or 'I won't buy Canadian seafood until this hunt is over'," said Pat Ragan of the Humane Society of the United States [HSUS] to "Reuters".
The International Fund for Animal Welfare sponsored two independent veterinary teams to observe the 2001 hunt which concluded the animals are often (42% of the time) killed in an inhumane manner and not in accordance with Canada's own laws.

A view of the Leonard Zakim bridge from the construction site. The warehouses at right will be replaced by a five-acre park within two years. The elevated roadway in the foreground is the John F. Gilmore Bridge.
Construction of two condominium buildings and a five-acre park began on March 21, in East Cambridge, Massachusetts. The buildings and park are part of the 45-acre Northpoint development, which will take 15 years and more than $2bn to complete, according to the "Boston Globe". The buildings, designated as "Building S" and "Building T" by the planners of the project, Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers, have been designed by local architectural firm Childs Bertman Tseckares and Architects Alliance from Toronto. Buildings S and T are the first of an eventual 20 buildings planned at the site.
The development will fill what used to be a railroad yard for the Guilford Rail System, a subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries. According to Hoovers.com, Guilford is controlled by Timothy Mellon, heir to the Mellon banking fortune. Guilford Rail Systems has its headquarters in North Billerica and owns 1600 miles of railroad throughout New England. The tracks in the Northpoint plot have been removed, though Boston subway's Lechmere station remains within walking distance of the site, along with parts of Boston and Cambridge. The site is bordered by Route 93 on its eastern side, Monsignor O'Brien Highway to the west, and the Gilmore Bridge to the south.
The landscape architecture of the park is provided by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, a landscape architecture firm on Concord Avenue in Cambridge. The firm's principal teaches in Harvard's Graduate School of Design. MVVA is also completing the landscape for Harvard's Northwest Science Building.

John Couey confessed to police in 1991 to molesting his stepdaughter; Never prosecuted

Last night, CNN's played a chilling police audio tape of a 1991 confession made by the accused killer of 9-year-old . On the tape, is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years. 
An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; "Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught." The officer continues, "Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did." CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.
The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he "needs help" and "wants help".
Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica.

American President George Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, and Mexican President Vicente Fox met at Baylor University in Waco, Texas on Wednesday. The leaders discussed cooperation in the areas of border security, trade, and immigration, signing an accord called the "Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America."
"In a rapidly changing world, we must develop new avenues of cooperation that will make our open societies safer and more secure, our businesses more competitive, and our economies more resilient," read a joint statement released by the three leaders.
The agreement calls for greater sharing of intelligence and the strengthening of infrastructure security. It also seeks to develop a common system for screening travellers, and promotes collaboration in the sectors of transportation, energy, technology, and financial services.
Each nation will set up ministerial-level working groups that will "set specific, measurable, and achievable goals and implementation dates" and "identify concrete steps the governments can take to achieve these goals," according to a White House press release. The initial reports are due within 90 days.
President Bush, while not offering specific details, also said that he would "continue to push for reasonable, common-sense immigration policy with the United States Congress."

Explosion at Texas refinery kills 14, injures more than 100

A huge explosion at the third-largest oil refinery in the United States killed at least 14 workers and injured more than 100 others at about 1:30 p.m. local time (19:30 UTC) on Wednesday, in Texas City, Texas.
The blast caused extensive damage to the BP facility, left a large crater in the ground, and flung chunks of burnt metal onto cars and trucks in the employee parking lot. Windows and lights shattered in homes and other buildings miles from the blast location. A massive cloud of black smoke hovered over the sky.
"It was real scary," refinery worker Charles Gregory told the "Associated Press". "Have you ever hear the thunder real loud? It was like 10 times that," he said.
Authorities do not suspect that the explosion was caused by terrorism, but have not yet determined the cause of the blast. Federal investigators have been sent to the site, according to Daniel Horowitz, the director of public affairs for the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.
"We have no reason to believe this was anything caused by an outside agent," said BP spokesman Hugh Depland.
The 1,200-acre facility employs 1,800 workers, and outputs three percent of the oil supply for the United States (almost half a million barrels a day). The western side of the facility directly affected by the blast makes high-grade fuel.
Firefighters worked for over two hours to fight blazes caused by the explosion.
Company officials have not yet announced how long production will be suspended at the refinery. Gasoline futures began trading higher at an all-time peak of $1.60 a gallon during after-hours trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but retreated to $1.58 later in the evening.
"It's a sad day for BP," said site director Don Parus.
Texas City last suffered a major accident in April 1947, when a ship filled with ammonium nitrate exploded, killing about a third of the town's population, and injuring about 5,000 others.

Woman finds human finger in bowl of chili at Wendy's restaurant

San Jose, California — A woman eating a bowl of chili at a Wendy's restaurant bit into a chewy bit that turned out to be a human finger. She immediately spat it out, warned other patrons to stop eating, and upon recognizing the object as a finger, vomited.
"I'm more of a Carl's Jr. person," the 39-year-old Las Vegas woman, Anna Ayala, told "Knight Ridder". She said this incident was her first visit to a Wendy's restaurant. Ayala described how she found the finger, "Suddenly something crunchy was in my mouth," she continued, "and I spit it out."
According to Devina Cordero, 20, after Ayala found the finger, she ran up to her and Cordero's boyfriend and said, "Don't eat it! Look, there's a human finger in our chili."
"We went up to the counter and they told us it was a vegetable," Cordero continued. "The people from Wendy's were poking it with a spoon."
The restaurant is located at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose.
Wikinews reporter drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a semi-trailer truck in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment.
According to Ben Gale, director of environmental health for Santa Clara County, the finger did not come from any of the employees at the restaurant. "We asked everybody to show us they have 10 fingers and everything is OK there," he said. The found portion of the finger likely belonged to a woman because of its long and manicured fingernail, also found in the food.
Officials seized the food supply at the restaurant and are tracing it back to the manufacturer, where they believe the finger may have gotten mixed in with the raw ingredients used to prepare the chili. The restaurant's operators were later permitted to re-open after preparing new chili prepared from fresh ingredients.
As this story was filed, there was no mention of the incident on the Wendy's corporate web site. Wendy's issued a statement through a spokesman.
"Food safety is of utmost importance to us," said Wendy's spokesman Joe Desmond. He referred to the incident as an "unsubstantiated claim."
"We are cooperating fully with the local police and health departments with their investigation. It's important not to jump to conclusions. Here at Wendy's we plan to do right by our customers," Desmond said.
According to county health officials, the unfortunate woman who bit into the finger is doing fine, despite her initial reaction. Officials also noted that the finger would have been cooked at a high enough temperature to destroy any viruses.
The Santa Clara county medical examiner reported that the finger had a solid fingerprint, although investigators did not say if a search of fingerprint databases would be performed to find the owner of the finger.

Iraqi, American forces raid insurgent training camp, killing 85

Iraqi and American forces raided a training camp in a remote, rural region 160 kilometers north of Baghdad on Wednesday, killing 85 insurgents. Seven Iraqi commandos were killed in the raid and six were injured, according to the US military.
In addition to placing the insurgent death toll at 85, the Iraqi government also said that between 500 and 700 Iraqi commandos took part in the raid.
After encountering heavy fire from an estimated 100 insurgents as they approached the camp, the Iraqi commandos called in support from the American 42nd Infantry Division, which sent in ground troops and attack helicopters. The battle began at approximately 11a.m. local time (0800 UTC) and lasted seven hours.
The training camp, located in a remote region near Lake Tharthar, which is adjacent to the predominantly Sunni Anbar and Salahuddin provinces, is the largest guerilla training camp that has been discovered in the war so far, according to Iraqi officials.
The insurgents had planned to attack the city of Samarra, located 55 kilometers east of the lake, with a large number of car bombs, according to the Iraqi Interior Ministry.
Iraqi officials claimed that most of the insurgents came from Arab countries, though men from the Philippines were also among the deceased insurgents. They also claimed to have captured one Algerian.
"The Arab countries are sending fighters into Iraq because they want to destroy our democratic movement," said General Rashid Flaiyeh, head of Iraqi police in Salahuddin Province, in an interview broadcast on state-run television network Al Iraqiya.

Hawkins' official recognition with the company will only be as 'founder', as the company will be led by Dubinsky. Hawkins will continue as chief technical officer of palmOne and remain at Redwood.
The company will not charge fees for its products during the first few years in order to encourage further development of the technology and build up a development community. The annual budget of more than $1 million will be paid by Hawkins and Dubinsky, who have raised an undisclosed amount from a handful of friends and associates.
Hawkins and third co-founder of Numenta, Dileep George, have been working on developing the technology since 2003, and have devised an example piece of software. Data is put into the program by showing it 90 different pictures. The software can then recognise any of the 90 objects, even when drawn incomplete or in bad quality. Pattern matching is still difficult for today's and software technologies. If outfitted with a camera, a sophisticated pattern matching system could be used by law enforcement to recognise the faces of wanted criminals in crowds.
Other notable attempts at creating more powerful computer systems include artificial intelligence, which started in the 1950s and took off in the mid 1980s and led to disappointment due to high expectations, and the , both fields are still in active development.

Arab summit comes to an end

 leaders ended their Wednesday with no new initiatives for peace with Israel. The summit, held in Algeria, coincided with the 60th anniversary of the Arab League.
The summit rejected Jordan's plan to normalise relations with Israel by instead sticking to the 2002 peace plan. That plan promised to normalise relations only after an Israeli withdrawal from , the creation of a Palestinian state, and the settlement of Palestinian refugees.
The summit announced the creation of an Arab Parliament to be based in the Syrian capital of Damascus. It will contain four members from each of the 22 Arab League states.
Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi, the longest serving Arab leader at the meeting, caused tensions by telling the Palestinian delegation he thought both "Palestinians and Israelis are stupid." He also reiterated his call for a single state solution, saying "the solution I think is to have a single state. We cannot have two states." He also addressed terrorism, claiming it was the result of "oppression, injustice, arrogance, insults, contempt and the humiliation of this [Arab] nation."

New figures released on Irish income distribution

New figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland confirmed that Dublin has the highest level of disposable income per person in the Republic of Ireland whilst Cavan, Donegal and Kerry have the lowest figures.
Taking 100% to be the national average, Dublin's disposable income per person was 13.4% above the national average, compared to the bottom three counties which were up to 16.5% below the national average.
According to the figures, only four counties in the country were above the average - Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Limerick. Six counties were less than 90% of the national average.
The figures indicate that Southern and Eastern regions have the highest levels of disposable income in the country. The Western, Border, Midland and Northern regions have the lowest levels.
The figures - althought the latest available - were put together in 2002. It is likely the situation has changed somewhat since then.

Canada set to rule on U.S. Army refugee

, 
The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada is scheduled to release its decision on Jeremy Hinzman's application for political refugee status.
The case is being closely watched as it will directly affect at least 8, and possibly more, U.S. military deserters in Canada, and could further strain relations between Washington, D.C. and Ottawa.
Hinzman's application was heard at a three-day immigration hearing in December. At the hearing he argued that he fled to Canada to avoid military service in Iraq in an illegal war, possibly making his participation a war crime under the Nuremberg tribunals. The U.S. Army has declared Hinzman "Absent Without Leave" (AWOL), and said he would face charges as a deserter which include the possibility of the death penalty.
"My life isn't that significant, but it's also not so worthless to be killed or go kill innocent people," said Hinzman.
Canada has accepted refugees in the past fleeing compulsory military service, but as Hinzman volunteered to serve this case is breaking new ground.
Hinzman is a practicing Buddhist, and applied for conscientious objector status in the Army in 2002 before his unit was ordered to Afghanistan. His application was rejected and he was ordered to ship out to Iraq in late 2003. At that time he and his family fled from his North Carolina base for Canada (his wife, Nga Nguyen, is also seeking asylum.)
The Immigration and Refugee Board's decision is expected Thursday afternoon on their website, and will not be announced publicly.

PBS cancels 'Wall $treet Week' after 35 years

 U.S. pubcaster, PBS said it was canceling its business magazine and interview program, "Wall $treet Week". The last new episode is scheduled to air on June 24.
The program, based in Owings Mills, Maryland, has been on the air continuously for 35 years, becoming one of the longest-running programs in U.S. television history. It had been struggling to regain audience lost after the producers fired long-time host Louis Rukeyser in 2002 and signed a controversial deal with AOL Time Warner to co produce the show with the editorial staff of "Fortune magazine".
According to a report in the "New York Times", after Rukeyser's dismissal, 22 of the show's regular expert guests vowed never to appear on the program again. Rukeyser was later hired by cable channel CNBC, where he hosted a program that aired in direct competition with "Wall $treet Week" in the U.S. eastern time zone until he fell ill in December 2004.

Entrepreneur's RFID chip implant to open doors, start car

A technology entrepreneur in northeastern Washington asked a doctor to implant an RFID chip into his hand in order to experiment with the technology. Amal Graafstra, who runs a technology company in Bellingham, WA, asked a doctor to place the chip under the skin of his left hand, and posted pictures of the procedure to the photo-sharing site, Flickr. Graafstra plans to use the chip for keyless entry to his car, home, or as a login for computer systems.
Implanting RFID chips is a relatively old technology. Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading, UK implanted a 23mm RFID chip into his left arm in August 1998. It allowed him to open doors and turn on the lights in a room as he entered. Further European research in the area was recently dealt a blow when the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies made a presentation to the European Union raising privacy concerns over the potential for such chips to be used to track members of the public.
In mid-2004, about 160 Mexican officials received RFID implants for security purposes, and scientists in the past have implanted themselves with such chips for research purposes. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the implantation of Verichip technology for medical purposes.
An implantable RFID chip is a minuscule capsule containing a microchip and an antenna, all enclosed in glass. The chip that Mr. Graafstra had implanted was 12mm long and 2mm in diameter — about the size of a grain of rice. RFID chips work by storing a unique identification number in the microchip. This number can be retrieved by a special RFID reader that is held within close proximity. Graafstra notes that his chip can be read from a distance of about 2 inches (5cm), and only provides the single identifying number.
Describing himself as a long-time tinkerer, Graafstra's comments do not show much of a hesitation to perform this process. "I like to mod things, and I guess it was only natural that it extended to my own body," he wrote in an email to Wikinews.
Graafstra appears to have been impressed by the process, too. "It was odd feeling it [the chip] being pushed under the surface of my skin... without feeling pain, I was able to really get a feel for just how utilitarian our bodies actually are and how... separate the skin layer really is from the muscle layer under it," he told Wikinews. He was able to use his hand to perform technical computer maintenance just an hour after the procedure.
RFID is a controversial technology. Privacy advocates fear that the technology might be abused by governments and used to track people. Microchip implants have been used for years for tracking lost pets.
The pictures that Graafstra posted spurred commentary in the blogosphere, with some assuming that the pictures — or the process — were faked. Graafstra denies this, and posted a short video of himself triggering the RFID reader with a swipe of his hand.

Akayev flees Kyrgyzstan as protesters seize control of Bishkek

Thousands of demonstrators, reportedly cheered on by residents, overran the Kyrgyz Presidential Palace, seizing control of Bishkek’s government buildings and forcing President Askar Akayev to flee the country.
Some 10,000 protesters gathered on central Ala-Too square in the country’s capital this morning. Fighting broke out between supporters of Akayev and the anti-Akayev protesters at the demonstration, and, although it was reportedly relatively minor, a "Reuters" witness reported hearing gun fire.
At the rally, the protesters gave speeches stating that the opposition would today finish taking control of the country. Keneshbek Dushebayev, newly appointed Interior Minister and chief of police for the city, called on them to give up their plans, but his pleas were dismissed by the protesters.
However, the Interior Minister assured them that the Akayev's regime would not use force against them, despite the fact that riot police suppressed a smaller demonstration the day before after he claimed that the use of force was lawful.
The Presidential Palace was reinforced with police forces and soldiers as about 5,000 protesters marched to the palace, chanting “down with the Akayev clans.”
The forces surrounding the building, which reportedly numbered in the hundreds, repelled an initial attempt to storm the building by the protesters, but the forces dispersed as about a thousand protesters fought back, armed with rocks and clubs, attempting to storm the building a second time. 
Once inside, hundreds of protesters ransacked the building, throwing portraits of Akayev out the windows and destroying documents.
Thirty people were injured, according to medical officials.
Interfax reported that Akayev had flown to Kazakhstan with his family by helicopter earlier. 
Former Vice President Felix Kulov, who was jailed in 2000, was among many political prisoners freed. He praised the "revolution made by the people."
"Let's keep the peace, let's not lose our head," he said into a megaphone on the steps of the palace, addressing the protesters. "I want to thank you that you weren't afraid and were peaceful and civilized."
Felix Kulov was quoted as saying that Akayev had resigned, though he denied this. "Akayev's resignation will come when we find him," he said.
The demonstrations began at about noon local time (0700 UTC), and, by 3:30 (1030 UTC), every government building in the capital was seized. The opposition quickly established a “Coordination Council of National Unity.”
"We will establish order. We will not allow looting. We will hold our own elections to start our rule," Kurmanbek Bakiyev, leader of the newly established Coordination Council said.
Confirming Interfax’s reports, he also said "Askar Akayev right now is not on Kyrgyz soil."
Former legislator Oksana Malevanaya, speaking for the Coordination Council on state television, now under opposition control, said that the former parliament would meet Thursday night.
Kyrgyz Supreme Court Chairman Kurmanbek Osmonov told the session of parliament that the court had declared the elections invalid. He reportedly stated that the court considered the convened former legislature as the legitimate one.
"It's not the opposition that has seized power, it's the people who have taken power. The people. They have been fighting for so long against corruption, against that [Akayev] family," Ulan Shambetov, an opposition activist, said.
Presidential elections are reportedly likely to be held in May or June, followed by parliamentary elections in the fall. The old parliament will serve as the legitimate legislature until the elections are be held.
Top government officials, including Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev, who cancelled his trip to Osh for negotiations today in light of the new developments, and State Secretary Osmonakun Ibraimov, resigned.
Opposition MP Ishinbai Kadyrbekov, former parliamentary speaker, was named acting president and newly freed Felix Kulov was named head of the ministries of security in the country by the parliament.
Elsewhere, in Batken, the third regional center in the south after now opposition controlled Osh and Jalal-Abad, hundreds of protesters broke through police lines and seized government buildings.
Monica Whitlock, a correspondent for the BBC, notes she observed that some protesters carried pink banners while others carried yellow ones, suggesting that the opposition is fractured.
Widespread looting reportedly continued overnight, as law enforcement officers were not present on Bishkek's streets. Bishkek was described as sinking into a state of "anarchy" by one observer, as gangs of people roamed the streets and plundered stores of consumer goods. Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for the lawlessness.
"There are looters and there are no police to stop them," Felix Kulov told "Reuters". "The law enforcement bodies are completely demoralised."
Amid the continued instability, Kazakhstan tightened security along its border with Kyrgyzstan, as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have recently done.

Sony's PlayStation Portable is launched in North America

Sony launched its eagerly anticipated PlayStation Portable (PSP) in the North American market today. The PlayStation costs $250 and plays MP3 files, movies and of course games.
Launched previously in Japan last year with much fanfare, the PSP quickly achieved sales of more than 800,000 units. The device is Sony's first major attempt at challenging Nintendo's long held grip on the market for handheld games. 
Nintendo currently holds a 90 percent of the market share for handhelds in North America. With the recent introduction of Nintendo DS, the fight for control of this market is expected to become even more intense. 
Japanese launch.
The first shipment of 200,000 PSP units were made available for purchase in Japan on December 12, 2004. All units sold out within the first two days. Some users reported problems with the launch units, including dead pixels (discolored squares) within the LCD screen and game discs ejecting abruptly if the system is twisted. Sony offered to replace these PSPs under warranty, but said they do not consider a display faulty unless four pixels are within 1cm (0.39 in) of each other. 
Games available for North American Launch.
Sony have said that the following titles will be launched during the "launch window":
Technical specifications.
The unit measures 170 mm (6.7 in) (Length) × 74 mm (2.9 in) (Width) × 23 mm (0.9 in) (Depth), and weighs 260 grams (9.17 oz) including the battery. The most noticeable element of the PSP is its 4.3" 16:9 ratio TFT LCD screen sporting a 480 x 272 pixel resolution capable of 16.77 million colors.
The PlayStation Portable's CPU is a MIPS R4000 (32-bit) CPU, split into two cores each operating between 1 and 333 MHz; the system has 32MB of main RAM and 4MB of embedded DRAM. The primary CPU core is responsible for traditional game processor functions; the secondary core, dubbed the "Virtual Media Engine", is responsible for decoding multimedia, for example the h.264 decoder. 
The independent 166 MHz graphics chip provides hardware polygon and NURBS rendering, clipping, morphing, texture compression and tessellation, along with handling image output. Specifications state that the PSP is capable of rendering 33 million flat-shaded polygons per second, with a 664 million pixel per second fill rate.
Unlike Sony's PlayStation 2 console, the GPU (PS2 Vector Unit equivalent) is not programmable.

A discussion group about weblogs, or blogs for short, that meets at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society last week began releasing video tutorials about how to blog using various web and software tools.
Harvard University's Berkman Center hosts the blogging discussion group, which has met weekly for the past two years.
After months of discussion and collaboration on the new tutorials, at Friday's evening meeting presenters showed off some of their early video tutorials, which stream recorded audio, and previously-captured video of a computer screen, along with simultaneous live audio from a microphone.
Participants learned how similar tutorials can be constructed using free software tools such as CamStudio. Audio of the session was made available on the World Wide Web.
Shimon Rura, a local software developer, presented 
a recent screen-capture + voiceover flash file he had made, demonstrating how to use a bookmarklet in the Frassle blogging package. Other participants discussed video demonstrations of how to podcast, and how to use specific blogging tools such as WordPress. 
There was also disussion of a recent initiative to set up a "Blogging101" site for distributing and translating these instructional materials. Rebecca MacKinnon, a noted blogger and Berkman Fellow, spoke about the BloggerCorps initiative to connect non-profits who want broader exposure with local blogging enthusiasts.

Yahoo adds Creative Commons search for locating reusable content

"Yahoo!" has launched a beta version search tool at http://search.yahoo.com/cc, designed to locate content on the web under a Creative Commons (CC) license. While most copyrighted material on the web does not allow reuse, other than "fair-use" allowances, copyrighted material held by Creative Commons licensing allows the public to reuse material in a variety of ways specified by the copyright holder under the licensing agreement.
The nonprofit organization behind the license, Creative Commons, was founded in 2002 by Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig. The organization provides 11 agreements customized for use in various countries. Depending on the licensing agreement, users can reproduce or modify the work as long as they mention the original creator. Some licenses prohibit reusing works in a commercial setting.
Not everyone is impressed by the new search tool. Shelley Powers, author of "Practical RDF" from O'Reilly Press, writes in her book's blog, "Since CC licenses are recorded using a standardized meta language," "Yahoo!" is, "just checking for this information in the process of their normal operations." John Batelle of Searchblog points out that A9.com incorporates a similar feature in A9.com's Open Search. Wikinews reporter found that A9.com requires registration and login to use the Creative Commons search.
Lessig recently reflected on Creative Commons' success in a guest post at "Yahoo!'s" search blog. Describing an event at the launch of Creative Commons Korea, he said: "At the end of our final celebratory dinner, one of the judges who had helped launch CC-Korea asked me, 'so what will make CC in the world as successful as CC-Korea?' And I recognized, for the first time, that this project that we started two and a half years ago had finally left home. I was no longer asking others to help; others were demanding from me a success to match their own."

A Spotsylvania County woman, whose three dogs allegedly attacked and killed her elderly neighbor, was freed Wednesday by posting a $10,000 bond. Dianna Large, 36, received one felony charge of involuntary manslaughter and three misdemeanor charges in an indictment issued last week.
In her first appearance before a judge, she answered Circuit Court Judge William H. Ledbetter questions with simple “Yes sir.” and “No sir.” responses. The short hearing, held Thursday, formalized the charges against her. The involuntary manslaughter charge, a first in the severity of punishment being sought on a dog owner in the Virginan state of USA, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.
State procecutor Wiliam Neely said that Large knowingly let her three Pit Bull dogs run free, and that an animal control agency person had warned her to keep them under better control. She also a violated a county ordinance requiring owners of dangerous dogs to post a warning sign to visitors. The prosecution also noted that none of the three male dogs were neutered.
The Animal Control Department of Virginia maintains a dangerous dog registry. It contains a list of owners whose dogs are deemed dangerous to society. The link to the registry was moved to a more prominent position on the county web page following the attack.

Protesters arrive at Baxter detention centre in Australian desert

Hundreds of protesters arrived at the Baxter detention centre in the desert to demonstrate against the incarceration of refugees held there. An additional 300 protesters converged on the home of Immigration Minister , in the state capital of , on their way to Baxter.
People from all over Australia are protesting against the Australian Government's policy of . The first protesters arrived by buses in early Friday morning.
Detainees seem split over the protest. "" reported Detainee Peter Qasim as saying, "It stops people from visiting us, it stops us receiving any calls. It is a good idea to protest but better somewhere other than here."
However, other detainees have been reported as saying, "It is better in front of Baxter, I believe showing Baxter, protesters will shout about human torture inside detention. Then there would be good publicity about all torture inside Baxter detention."
And, "We welcome all of [the protesters] and we thank [them] all who has seen disgrace of this human torture. Further we thank to you all who come and visit and looking after us all the time, we need it."
Despite fears of violence, there has been no confrontation between the police and the protesters.

Scientists discover soft tissue in dinosaur bones

Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in Montana.
MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.
Results similar to the popular film "Jurassic park" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.
Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding "opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level."
Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was "pretty exciting stuff." "You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."

Five dead, over 200 injured as looting continues in Bishkek

RTR television reported 5 people died and about 200 were injured as looting continued Thursday night in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. The newly appointed head of security ministries, Felix Kulov, said at least 31 police officers were wounded.
Windows were smashed, shops were looted, and shopping centers were set ablaze during the unrest. Gunshots were also heard.
"Former President [Askar] Akayev is personally responsible for this. He had a chance to resign, instead of which he ran away," Kulov said. "The looters kept shouting 'this shop belonged to the [Akayev] family, this is why it is ours'."
The Kyrgyz ambassador to the United States, Baktybek Adrisaev, characterized the opposition's actions as "an anti-constitutional coup." The ambassador claimed that Akayev was in "a safe place" and that he had not resigned.
Most reports, although unconfirmed, said Akayev was in Kazakhstan. However, Interfax, by a source they described as "credible", reported he was in the resort area of Borovoye, in the Akmola region of northern Kazakhstan.
"I cannot confirm these rumors. He is simply not here," Ruslan Aubakirov, head of district administration, told RIA Novosti in response to the reports.
Opposition MP Ishinbai Kadyrbekov had initially been named acting president yesterday, but today opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev was named both acting president and prime minister. "Parliament today appointed me prime minister and gave me the functions of president," he said to applause at a rally.
He urged opposition supporters to not allow looting and stressed that popular opposition figure, Felix Kulov, would coordinate law enforcement. Heads of law enforcement agencies reportedly told Kulov that 90% of their staff were demoralized during consultations last night. Despite these developments, Bakiyev declined to declare a state of emergency.
Bakiyev, outlining his plans for government on Friday, told a session of parliament, "Let me create an executive body of power that will not exist forever, but for about three months."
Kulov, newly freed from prison by protesters, stated he would return to prison when he was no longer needed. "I was sentenced to imprisonment 
and must serve my time," he said. "I am not interested in posts or positions. I was just asked to help protect people and their property."
Russia and the United States, who both have military bases in the country, vowed to stay out of events. Security at Russia's base was increased, although both countries said they did not expect trouble at their bases.
"Kyrgyzstan is not planning to review its previous international engagements," Kurmanbek Bakiyev told reporters. "This applies to the air bases of the [U.S.-led] anti-terrorism coalition and the Russian air base at Kant."
The United States called for fresh elections , and Russia has pledged to work with the opposition. Russian President Vladimir Putin also announced that Akayev would be welcome in Russia.

Kidnapped Italian journalist refutes American government claims

Italian journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, who was hit by American artillery fire after being rescued from kidnappers in Iraq, was released from the hospital Thursday. Her injuries, more serious than initially reported, were caused by a projectile that burst her shoulder open and punctured her lungs. She suffers with fluid build-up in her lungs to this day and was unable to leave her home to participate in news interviews. 
Sgrena told an independent reporter, Naomi Klein, in a report yesterday (Friday, 3/26/2005) on the "Pacifica Radio Network" broadcast called "Democracy Now with Amy Goodman," that they were not on a high security airport road which the Americans had claimed. There were no "checkpoints" — they had already passed through them in the Green Zone. Sgrena stressed this as being very important to this story, and little reported upon in the U.S.
She said they received permission from security officials to use a little known, but very secure, road that was near to their airport destination. This road had no roadside bombs — it is not open to the public and has absolutely no military checkpoints. Access to the road was gained by first passing through the American-held security territory called the "Green Zone". Located in the heart of Baghdad, the zone is probably the only partly secure area of the entire country, according to Sgrena. They had their headlights on for easy identification while they traveled, and were in mobile phone contact with Italian security officials.
Ms. Sgrena asks why a tank would fire high velocity munitions at a small vehicle with permission to cross on such a secure road with absolutely no other traffic? What would the motive be to have her killed? It is known that the anti-artillery munitions were 4 inch long armor-plate penetrating rounds, which could explain her severe injury and the death of her body guard.
Her tragedy and the death of Nicola Calipari have been very detrimental to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's public opinion, particularly regarding his participation in the U.S. invasion of Iraq. She had just been released from a horrible sequence of events beginning with her kidnapping and imprisonment in a small room. She did not know "night from day for an entire month." She feared the house she was in might come under fire from American helicopter gunships. She could hear them overhead at all hours of the day and night.
She was told by her kidnappers that "Americans did not want her to get out alive," which she dismissed at the time as a threat from the kidnappers. She also said the statement by the kidnappers had an eerie overtone to it, since she knew that Bush didn't want any independent journalists to carry tales out of the killing zones, or to talk to everyday Iraqis. 
According to Sgrena, she was placed in the back seat of the escape vehicle with the head of Italy's Foreign Military Intelligence, Nicola Calipari, after her release. He was killed during the attack when he shielded Sgrena from bullets by jumping across her body. The shooting was done by heavy artillery on top of the attacking tank, not a simple machine gun. They fired at Sgrena from behind — hardly a situation where the car could be a threat to the tank. When the driver, Giulian, climbed out of the shot-up car, he was in touch with his superiors in Italy — and Ms. Sgrena says he was telling them they had been taking intense gunfire, "300 to 400 shots." The Americans aimed guns at him and told him to hang up immediately.
Klein, the reporter with this story, stated the American press has not reported any of this. Nor have they given the American people any idea of the seriousness of the injuries to Sgrena. Sgrena also questioned why the US Army was not aware of her release from kidnapping, as all of the major news wires had reported it prior to the shooting incident.
Late Thursday, Italian Justice minister, Roberto Castelli, contacted American officials for permission allowing Italian police access to the escape car, a Toyota Corolla which was rented from the Baghdad airport. Americans have previously only permitted Italian authorities access to photographs of the car, and have not stated when they will allow the Italians to have access to the vehicle.
Recently Mr. Berlusconi has begun to backpedal on his statement that Italian troops would be out of the war zone by September. He now claims he never said that, and Italians won't leave Iraq until it can police itself.

Terri Schiavo's father made a last-minute appeal to have his daughter's feeding tube reinserted Friday.
"Terri is weakening. She's down to her last hours," said Bob Schindler, Schiavo's father. "Something has to be done and done quick."
Bob Schindler and his wife Mary filed an emergency appeal Friday to have a feeding tube reinserted in their 41-year-old daughter. Earlier Friday, U.S. District Judge James Whittemore rejected the family's previous appeal. On Wednesday, he rejected a similar request.
The new appeal will be filed in the in , although that court has twice before rejected the family's appeal.

Taiwan Democratic Alliance for Peace plans massive rally on Saturday

Over 500 groups, including the Democratic Progressive Party, are planning a massive march and rally for Saturday in Taipei City. March promoters are vowing to bring one million people onto the streets to protest the People's Republic of China's "anti-secession" law aimed at thwarting Taiwan independence.
The march, titled "326 March for Democracy and Peace", will begin in ten different locations, converging on the square near the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei City.
"Democracy and peace are the ultimate goal of the march," said Joseph Wu, the Mainland Affairs Council Chairman. Wu announced on Friday that he would take part in the rally, but did not disclose in which part of the parade he would appear.
Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian announced on Thursday that he will also attend the event with his family.
"I cannot and will not be absent on March 26, and I will take my entire family to participate in this sacred moment in history to walk and stand up together with the Taiwanese people," Chen said. Chen further declared that he has, "heard the outrage and anger of the Taiwan people."
A Chinese scholar warned that the situation could become "further aggravated" by Saturday's planned event.
"The secessionist forces plot to stir up public sentiments to embolden themselves. Such moves are doomed to meet failure," said Huang Jiashu, a professor at the People's University of China. He stated that secessionist forces had "malevolently distorted" the anti-secession law.
The "Taiwan Domestic News Hour" on "ETTV" is running a "326" graphic to note the march and rally during its news reports about the upcoming event, and also has an animated graphic with marchers carrying signs in the lower-left hand corner of the screen.

Ruling forbids RadioShack brand in Canada

A U.S. District Court in Tarrant County, Texas, issued a summary judgment Thursday against Circuit City's InterTAN Inc., requiring all 950 RadioShack stores in Canada to stop using the RadioShack brand in store signs, packaging, products and advertising after June 30.
RadioShack's Canadian operations were spun off in 1986 to a new corporation, InterTAN Canada, which was purchased in 2004 by RadioShack's major U.S. competitor, Circuit City. Shortly thereafter, RadioShack sued InterTAN, alleging it had violated the terms of their licensing agreement and seeking the right to terminate the contract early. 
In a statement released following the judge's ruling, RadioShack's general counsel, Mark Hill, claimed: "The most important thing to us was to protect our brand position in Canada." 
Circuit City chairman and chief executive officer, W. Alan McCollough responded today in a press release seeking an appeal: "We respectfully believe the court has erred in the partial ruling entered yesterday and we will use every means of relief possible to exercise our rights under the agreements, including all appeal rights. The Company believes the positions taken by InterTAN are correct and believe InterTAN will ultimately prevail in the legal proceedings."

NRA official suggests arming teachers to prevent school shootings

A lawyer who is expected to become the president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a comment to Associated Press (AP) that arming teachers with firearms is a solution to be considered in preventing school shootings by students. Sarah S. Froman, an alumni of Harvard Law School and a practicing lawyer, implied that allowing teachers to carry weapons is one of the many options that should be examined.
Guns and other weapons are commonly banned on school campuses in the United States, but the high-profile incidents of students defying the bans and bringing firearms to classes could place the school at a disadvantage if the student were to fire the weapon. In the case of the recent student shooting at a Native American reservation in Minnessota the school had metal detectors and had an on-duty security guard. The guard was unarmed, however, and was gunned down by the student.
Froman told the AP that if it is the responsibility of teachers to protect students from harm, then the society must find a way to let teachers do that. She also said that gun control laws or bans cannot prevent a malicious individual from acting out, and provided an example of a 1997 shooting incident where an armed teacher was able to help police apprehend the student.
Froman is currently the NRA's first vice president, and is expected to be elected to the post of president in the organization's elections next month. The current president of the 4-million member organization is actor and activist Charlton Heston.

IBM releases freeware for visualizing document histories

IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in Cambridge released a free tool March 25 for visualizing the changing history of a document or directory of documents, called "history flow". The tool offers a variety of views of document histories, including a view that gives each revision equal importance, and a timeline view which displays each revision proportionally to how long it remained current. Each different editor who makes changes to the article has a distinct color, allowing for that editor's text to be tracked over time. 
The tool was first developed in 2003 by a collaboration between Fernanda B. Viégas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM. It was initially tested out on a large subset of the pages of Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia project which preserves every change made to each of its articles. The resulting paper was drafted in the winter of 2003 and presented at a conference in April 2004; it remains the most comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of articles in an active wiki community. A year later, the history flow paper is still the most frequently cited source of statistics about the reversion of vandalism on Wikipedia.
The current tool is maintained by Martin Wattenberg and Jonathan Feinberg at IBM. It allows users to download the text and histories of the contents of any MoinMoin wiki, or to view the history of the contents of an entire directory of documents. The tool is free to download and use, but its code is not open source. The support for MoinMoin wikis comes via a plugin, so the tool may be extensible to the native interfaces of other wiki engines in the future.

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visits Brazil

Tuesday (March 22) the United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld arrived in Brazil for a visit with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Vice-President and Defense Minister José Alencar, and other top officials.
In a meeting with President Lula DaSilva and his Vice-President and Minister of Defense, José Alencar, Mr Rumsfeld discussed Brazil leading the UN military forces in Haiti, terrorism and narcotrafficking.
Rumsfeld told to AFP journalists:
"The United States has put forward four topics, which we have agreed to take up: application of a law to down [drug traffickers' aircraft]; [UN] operations in Haiti; drug trafficking; and the fight against terrorism, including Brazil's position on security in South America." 
Joint Press Conference.
Rumsfeld and Alencar held a Joint Press Conference in Brasilia, the capital city of Brazil.
Rumsfled stated that the friendship between Brazil and United States is long-standing and highly-valued. He added that the US and Brazil were allies in the Second World War and partners in helping to shape key post-war institutions including the United Nations.
Journalists asked both José Alencar, and Mr Rumsfeld if they were concerned about Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, particularly after his recent purchase of 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles.
Rumsfeld said:
The Brazilian Vice-President said that Brazil prefers not to interfere in the affairs of others: 
President Lula is scheduled to meet President Hugo Chávez, the President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe Velez and Spain's prime minister, José Luiz Zapatero next Tuesday in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela.
The Workers' Party Secretary for International Foreign Relations didn't agree with the US Defense Secretary regarding Venezuela. He said that his "declaration, does not contribute to a process of stabilization of the United States' relations with Latin America. It is a kind of mentality that, unhappyly, still is present in the American state, which considers Latin America as an extension of its territory." 
Rumsfeld praised Brazil's leadership in United Nations operations in Haiti where they have maintained order in the country after the overthrow of former President Jean Bertrand Aristide in February 2004.
A reporter asked Mr Rumsfeld whether Brazil is ready to have a seat on the UN Security Council. He answered by saying the Department of Defense doesn't have a voice or a role in that and the matter should be answered by the US President and the Secretary of State.
FARC and SIVAM.
Journalists asked the Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar three if Brazil will declare the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as a terrorist organization and if the government is worried about the FARC infiltration in Brazilian territory. Alencar was evasive and he refused to answer the questions directly. 
Alencar said Brazil repudiates narcotrafficking and that "if the organization adopts crime as an instrument for raising resources, obviously it is something that must be combated." 
Later he became impatient and said that he had already said everything he had to say. , 
Mr Rumsfeld visited SIVAM, the Amazon Surveillance System. SIVAM, which was built by U.S. Defense contractor Raytheon Corporation, is an arrangement of interconnected sensors and radars to supervise both environmental conditions and criminal activity in the Amazon, 
According to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB), about 60 activists protested in the Amazon against the visit of Rumsfeld when he was touring SIVAM.
Renato Rabelo, the President of the PCdoB released a note repudiating the visit of the US Secretary. "The Communist Party of Brazil repudiates the presence in domestic territory of the secretary of the Defense of the United States, Donald Rumsfeld. The undesired visitor is one of the main expoents of the tyrant and imperialist government of the United States", says a excerpt.

Morogoro Plastic will open a plastic grinding plant in the Tanzania town of Morogoro in April of 2005, according to Faustine Rwambali of the "East African". The grinding plant will be followed by a network of 5 washing plants around Tanzania. 75% of the $2m (2bn Tsh) investment needed to build the system of plants has been provided by Barclays. The first three washing plants will be in Mwanza, Arusha, and Dar es Salaam, followed by a plant on the island of Zanzibar and one in the southern part of the country.
The "East African", a weekly business paper published by the Aga Khan's Nation Media Group, reports the grinding plant will have a daily capacity of 3 tons of plastic. This capacity will be upgraded to 10 tons per day once equipment ordered from Portugal arrives in June, reported IPPMedia, the news arm of East African beverage conglomerate IPP Holdings. Praful Ladwa, the director of Morogoro Plastic, claims Tanzania produces 1000 tons of plastic per day. Once the full network of plants is functioning, Ladwa hopes it will be able to handle more than 75% of that waste stream.
According to the "East African", Tanzania has 15 to 20 plastics companies. Ladwa said the new plant system will be the "first of its kind in East and Central Africa." Morogoro Plastic plans to expand its recycling operations into neighboring Kenya and Uganda by 2007. Ladwa asserted that the system would create at least 10,000 jobs in the region.

Protests continue at Baxter detention centre

Three and maybe four protesters were arrested as demonstrations entered their second day at the Baxter detention centre in the South Australian desert. The protesters were arrested trying to get closer to the faculty. Along with hundreds of other protesters, they marched to the back of the centre but were met by police in riot gear as well as mounted police.
Two activists from Brisbane were arrested in the action, while a third person, who wished not to be identified, was also arrested. Protesters report that a fourth person appears to be missing.
An estimated 400 protesters have been camping around four kilometres from the centre over the Easter weekend, to highlight the Australian Government's policy of mandatory detention. Police have been using helicopters to watch the protesters as they have marched from their campsite to the centre.
More than 200 police charged at protesters as they marched toward the centre. The protesters had formed a tight group and were slowly marching towards the centre. One protester received a minor arm injury during the clash.
"I think it was quite over the top," said protester Mark Goudkamp. "I mean it was pretty clear [by] the way that we were marching in very slowly, very packed as a united group that we didn't pose any threat to the security of the centre on the inside."
"Everyone was banded together and people at the front knocked down the fences and we moved forces past the barrier and down to the detention centre,” said Kate, a protester from Brisbane.
“We pushed forward and got quite a fair way into the space. The cops rode horses to try to ward us off and generally tried to intimidate us. I was scared, but I felt safe within the group,” she said.
Police have said that they will charge several protesters over damage estimated at several hundred Australian dollars caused during last night's demonstration. The damage is mainly political graffiti and minor damage to a wooden fence just outside the detention centre.
One protester said that despite the threat of prosecution he would continue such actions. "I don't want trouble but... we have nothing but our hands," he said.
"With our hands and with our voices we are going to free the refugees. If the property is being used unjustly, as it is in this case, I think it is the right of every right-thinking person to damage that property to free those held unjustly as the refugees are in Baxter."
However Mark Goudkamp said that this was a minority view. "[The property damage] was a very, very small incident amongst everything else that happened. Of course [police] are going to try to focus in on that to portray it in whatever negative light they can to try to justify their over-the-top presence here," he said.

A conflict erupted between Greek Orthodox monks and Arab Christians in Jerusalem on Good Friday, as the Arab Christians protested the monks' sale of church land to Jewish residents.
Israeli police broke up the protest near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Omar Harani, a 25-year-old leading the protesters, told the "Telegraph", "We gave the land 2,000 years ago to the Church to look after," and continued, "So it is not their land to sell. For hundreds of years we Christians, who used to be 15 per cent of the population, have been persecuted and driven out of the Holy Land and now we are a tiny minority.

Christians from many countries flocked to Jerusalem on Friday, to follow the traditional Via Dolorosa, or "Way of Sorrows", marking the various spots in the city at which Jesus stopped, according to Christian tradition, on the way to his crucifixion on the hill of Calvary. 
Some of the visitors carried large crosses, and others had crowns of thorns on their head.
Visitors from far-flung locales including Ireland, the Philippines, and the United States have been coming in numbers much higher than in previous years, when regular occurrences of violence caused travel to Israel to plummet.
"With the ceasefire and Arafat’s successor, there’s even less reason to worry," said 38-year-old Connon McCabe, from Dublin, Ireland.
"In the last 15 days, we’ve seen hundreds more visitors," said Muslim shopkeeper Hashim Melki. "I like having people in my shop again after four years," Melki said.
Israeli police estimated attendance at the event was about 3,500.

U.S. willing to sell F-16s to Pakistan, India

The United States announced that it will be willing to sell F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan on Friday. U.S. State Department officials said that the sale would improve regional security.
A senior U.S. official, speaking to AFP on conditions of anonymity, reportedly said that the amount of planes which will be sold to Pakistan is "relatively small," although he said that" there is no set limit on what the United States is going to be willing to sell."
Pakistan reportedly wants 25 of the planes, which have a maximum range of over 2,000 miles and are capable of being used for ground or air attacks.
President Bush personally telephoned Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to inform him of the new developments before the announcement, according to White House officials.
According to a spokesman for Singh, the Indian prime minister expressed "great disappointment" and said that it could have "negative consequences" for the security of India.
The senior U.S. official also said that "we don't see any impact on the relevant military balances in the region." He added that the United States would be willing to sell both F-16 and more technologically advanced F-18 fighters to India, if India desired them.
"New Delhi Television" reports that the offer "has been welcomed" by India's Ministry of External Affairs. "Xinhua" has stated that India is seeking a new contract for a purchase of 126 fighter planes. 
The announcement was also welcomed by the Pakistani government. "We welcome this good gesture and it shows good friendship between Pakistan and the United States," Pakistani Information Minister Sheikh Rashid said.
"Xinhua" reported that potential sales could benefit US aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, which hopes to fill "looming gaps in the production line."
The company "has not been officially notified by the U.S. government of any agreement", Lockheed spokesman Tom Jurkowsky told the "Washington Post". The Bethesda-based company said that it would have to close its production line in Fort Worth, Texas if it does not receive additional orders by this fall.

Deep Impact cruising for comet crash

NASA's comet busting spacecraft Deep Impact has moved into its cruising phase towards a rendezvous and collision with Comet Tempel 1 on July 4, 2005.
The cruising phase is the second of five phases mission planners have set for the mission. The first commissioning phase was begun soon after launch and was designed to test and calibrate the instruments on board the two-part spacecraft. All instruments have checked out except for the High Resolution Instrument (HRI).
Mission controllers performed a "bake-out" or heating of the HRI to remove moisture that accumulated during the craft's final hours on the launch pad and its travel through the atmosphere. Test images taken after the procedure indicate the device has not reached perfect focus. A special team has been assigned to investigate and bring the instrument into full focus.
"This in no way will affect our ability to impact the comet on July 4," said Rick Grammier, Deep Impact project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Everyone on the science and engineering teams is getting very excited and looking forward to the encounter."
Deep Impact has four data collectors to observe the effects of the cometary collision: the High Resolution Instrument consisting of a camera and infrared spectrometer; the Medium Resolution Instrument; and a duplicate camera on the Impactor Targeting Sensor. They will record the vehicle's final moments before it slams into comet Tempel 1 at a relative velocity of 37,000 kilometers per hour (23,000 miles per hour). The Medium Resolution Instrument and Impactor Targeting Sensor are performing as expected.
Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland added, "We are very early in the process of examining the data from all the instruments. It appears our infrared spectrometer is performing spectacularly, and even if the spatial resolution of the High Resolution Instrument remains at present levels, we still expect to obtain the best, most detailed pictures of a comet ever taken."
Deep Impact is a two part vehicle: the flyby spacecraft and a smaller impactor. 24 hours prior to impact, the flyby craft will aim tracking telescopes at the comet and release the impactor.
The impactor is a battery-powered spacecraft that operates independently of the flyby spacecraft for just one day. It is called a “smart” impactor because, after its release, it takes over its own navigation and maneuvers into the path of the comet. The crater produced by the impactor is expected to range from the width of a house up to the size of a football stadium and be from two to 14 stories deep. Ice and dust debris will be ejected from the crater revealing the material beneath.
NASA's Hubble, Spitzer and Chandra space telescopes, along with the largest telescopes on Earth, will observe the effects of the material flying from the comet's newly formed crater along with the imagers aboard Deep Impact.
Deep Impact was launched on January 12, 2005 on board a Delta 2 rocket.

Gender imbalance in Tsunami deaths

Up to four times as many women as men died in the December 26 Indian Ocean Tsunami, figures published by Oxfam International today reveal.
"In some villages it now appears that up to 80% of those killed were women. This disproportionate impact will lead to problems for years to come unless everyone working on the aid effort addresses the issue now. We are already hearing about rapes, harassment and forced early marriages. We all need to wake up to this issue and ensure the protection, inclusion and empowerment of the women that have survived,” said, Becky Buell, Oxfam’s Policy Director.
As well as recognition of the disparity, and further research, Oxfam calls for a number of practical measures including assistance for men in affected areas to "adapt to changing gender roles including caring of children" and better protection for women, who may be finding themselves severely outnumbered by men.
As well as reporting that workers on the ground have been "becoming increasingly aware that a disproportionate percentage of the fatalities there were female", the study looks in detail at a number of locations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and , the three countries with greatest death toll from the disaster, and finds consistently that women killed outnumber men.
The differences are explained in the report as originating both in differences in ability — more men can swim and climb trees in the affected areas than women, and men are generally physically stronger — as well as in differences in activity that the individuals were engaged in at the time the tsunami struck — many women in Aceh were indoors at home with the children on a Sunday morning, while many men were fishing at sea, or on errands.
In India, many of the women were waiting at the sea-shore for men to bring home the catch, when the wave hit. The wave at sea had not yet broken, and so posed no threat to vessels far enough from shore.
In Sri Lanka in Batticoloa District, the tsunami hit at the hour women on the east coast usually took their baths in the sea.
Women looking after children at the time of the tidal wave were further distracted by trying to save their children, while men away from the house were able to dedicate more of their efforts to saving themselves.
Another factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave.
The survey looked at Aceh Besar district of Indonesia, the North Aceh district, the two worst-affected districts of Tamil Naidu in South India, being Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, and used rough statistics and anecdotal information from Sri Lanka, where hard figures are not available.

Pope John Paul II, the most visible global Christian leader and head of the largest Christian denomination, Roman Catholicism, has for the first time been unable to lead traditional Good Friday services in Rome.
He appeared to worshippers via a video presentation from the Vatican.
The Catholic leader has been diagnosed with pulmonary illness and Parkinson's disease.
Catholic services on this day are strictly liturgies of the word with an optional Eucharist, as the Mass cannot be celebrated on Good Friday.

India may rise as regional power

In the wake of 's March 26 announcement that it intends to build its first indigenous aircraft carrier, and recent American overtures aimed at greater defense cooperation to help make India a "major power," speculation is rife as to the future geopolitical consequences for the Asian region and the world.
India's rise to greater military power may serve as a counterbalance to in the Asian region. China is interested in developing a free trade pact with India and has made overtures in that direction, which are under consideration in India.
Indeed, China's military might is also increasing at a rapid rate as that nation's government commits an ever-greater percentage of its budget to national defense.
Nonetheless, the two nations are seeking a free trade agreement (FTA), which some observers have declared as having the potential to be "the most significant event of this decade" for the Asian region.

Hundreds of thousands march in Taipei

Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of Taipei Saturday evening, as several political parties and the Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian voiced their opposition to the new anti-secession law passed by mainland China last week.
Protestors chanted "Oppose war, Love Taiwan" in what has been termed a "democratic carnival" in downtown Taipei. The "carnival" consisted of activities of different themes relating to Taiwanese national sovereignty and cross-straits relations.
Reuters news agency reports that organisers had hoped to attract one million people to the marches, but police estimate an attendance of only 230,000 so far.
"I am here to protest against a barbaric China who looks down upon the Taiwanese people," said Fan Wen-yi, a 70-year-old businessman. "The anti-secession law, simply put, is a law that authorises war. If they really see Taiwan people as their compatriots, why do they enact such a law?"

Hundreds of thousands protest anti-secession law in Taiwan

Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of Taipei, Taiwan on Saturday, as several political parties, 500 civic groups, and President Chen Shui-bian voiced their opposition to the "anti-secession" law passed by the People's Republic of China last week.
The "Associated Press" and the "Sydney Morning Herald" estimated turnout at close to one million. Police spokesman Tan Szu-huai initially provided an estimate of about 300,000, but "AP" is reporting a revised police estimate of one million. "Reuters" news agency reports that organisers had hoped to attract one million people to the march.
"What do we want from China? Peace!" DPP lawmaker Bikhim Hsiao chanted with the crowd.
Hsiao told "CNN", "[This law] essentially gives China a blank check to use force against Taiwan, and they are the ones legislating, they are the ones interpreting the law, and executing and implementing the law."
President Chen participates.
Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian joined the protesters with his family and a security escort at 3pm local time. Chen is not scheduled to make a major speech to the crowd once they assemble at Presidential Office in downtown Taipei City, although he will preside over a ceremony with songs for each of the four major ethnic groups before the rally ends.
Protestors chanted "Oppose war, Love Taiwan" amongst what has been termed a "democratic carnival" in downtown Taipei. The "carnival" consisted of activities on different themes relating to Taiwanese national sovereignty and cross-straits relations.
Protestors attended from all over Taiwan, many braving arduous ten-hour or longer bus rides to Taipei.
Taiwan's former president Lee Teng-hui, the spiritual leader of the pro-independence TSU, and Premier Frank Hsieh, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, are also taking part in the march.
Vice President Annette Lu is expected to make an appearance at the Presidential Office.
Taiwanese television station "ETTV" on its "Taiwan Domestic Newshour" and others are providing live coverage as the march and rally progresses.
Reaction from China.
Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the Council for Advanced Policy Studies in Taiwan, told "Bloomberg", "China probably won't respond too strongly to the rally, focusing instead on how to make progress in terms of a peaceful, pragmatic approach."
At the time this story was filed, China's state-controlled "Xinhua" and "People's Daily" news agencies had no immediate comment about the march or the planned rally, but earlier today, "Xinhua" reported that on Friday, a Chinese expert "urged the Taiwan authorities to grasp the 'sincerity and goodwill' expressed in the Anti-Secession Law," stating that "Taiwan independence" secessionist forces had "malevolently distorted" the legislation and "sought to instigate hostility" between the two sides.
China's state-run news agencies also quoted professors from Chinese universities on Friday, who warned that the situation could become "further aggravated" by Saturday's planned event.

Police, militia confront looters in Bishkek, leaders say city now calm

A 6:00 p.m.-6:00 a.m. curfew was imposed in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek on Friday night as policemen and some 2,000 voluntary civilian militia members patrolled the streets. They were authorized to shoot into the air to disperse the looters.
Three to six people were killed as sporadic gunfire was heard in the capital overnight, and 129 people were detained.
Felix Kulov, newly appointed coordinator of law-enforcement, said of the situation on Friday, "The city looks as if it has gone mad."
However, after the night's events, he was confident that the situation had improved. "The situation is fully under control. We do not need a curfew," he said Saturday morning.
"Voluntary people's militia groups and units of the Kel-Kel opposition youth organization are responsible for maintaining order in the city," a source within the Interior Ministry told Interfax.
The opposition has now claimed that it did not originally intend to seize government buildings in Bishkek on March 24.
"On March 24 we didn't plan to seize the government headquarters in Bishkek, we were getting together for a peaceful rally. But when stones started flying at the rally, the people blew up and seized the Kyrgyzstan government headquarters," Rosa Otunbayeva, newly appointed minister of foreign affairs, told a news conference on Friday.
Akayev vows to return.
Deposed president Askar Akayev claimed that he had not resigned and vowed to return to the country in the future, in a statement released to ITAR-TASS. 
"The rumours about my resignation from the presidential post are deceitful and malevolent," he said in the statement. "Under the circumstances I decided to temporarily leave the country to avoid bloodshed."
Akayev stressed, "my present stay out of the country is a temporary occurrence." 
Interfax reports that Akayev flew to Russia from Kazakhstan Friday night. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Akayev would be welcome in Russia.
Borders closed.
China closed its border with Kyrgyzstan temporarily, until March 28, following similar closings by the countries of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Tajikistan has left some crossings open but has tightened security.
Many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China have issued travel advisories, advising their citizens not to travel to Kyrgyzstan because of the unrest.
Officials with the State Department say the United States accepts the "realities on the ground" and will work with the interim Kyrgyz authorities to build democratic institutions.
The European Union called for the people of Kyrgzstan to behave "responsibly" and offered to cooperate with the new leaders.
Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, also added that "The EU will continue to support the efforts of the OSCE mission in Bishkek."
Russia has said that part of the responsibility for triggering the uprising lies with the OSCE. Russian ambassador to the OSCE, Alexei Borodavkin, told AFP that the OSCE report on shortcomings in the Kyrgyz parliamentary elections in February and March of 2005 had "to some extent, triggered the unrest."
Russia has also called the revolution "illegal," although Russian authorities have also offered to cooperate with the interim Kyrgyz authorities.

Chinese government to safeguard old Beijing

Beijing's city legislature has approved a bill, one year in the making, to safeguard the historical and cultural heritage of old Beijing. The new 41-article set of regulations will come into effect May 1, requiring the city to protect listed heritage sites and unlisted sites deemed of historical or cultural value. It also guarantees protection for the area within the city's Second Ring Road.
Director of the Beijing Administrative Bureau of Cultural Heritage, Mei Ninghua, said "the most encouraging content of the regulations is that Beijing will pay more attention to protecting the old city's landscape in its entirety, rather than just focussing on scattered heritage sites." This means the old city layout, colours of buildings, and the names of houses and lanes will have legal protection.
"We took measures to protect the city's siheyuan courtyard houses by tagging protection plates on more than 650 of them in 2003, preventing them from being demolished or damaged during the city's massive housing reconstruction projects," said Mei.
"Now the new regulations give legal buttress to the protection of siheyuan courtyard homes, as well as other unmovable ancient treasures, that have yet to be listed but are at risk of being demolished during urban renovation."
Modern Beijing, capital of China for 850 years, was built by Mongul Emporer Kublai Khan in 1267 AD. In the vicinity of the current city once was Ji (蓟), the capital of the State of Yan (燕), a power of the Warring States Period - but it has been lost in the mists of time.

Multiple parliaments meet in Kyrgyzstan, legitimacy uncertain

Although the Supreme Court reportedly annulled recent election results on March 24, two rival parliaments have been meeting in the Kyrgyz capital of . The Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to endorse the legitimacy of the newly elected and protested parliament on Saturday. 
Both a pre-election chamber, comprising of an upper and lower house, and a post-election chamber, comprising of single house, met in separate rooms of the parliament building on Saturday. MPs from both parliaments are set to meet and debate how to proceed. Among solutions proposed are keeping both parliaments functioning until the next election.
"Our opinion is that we should be the legitimate lawmakers because the people have chosen us," said Roman Shin, who was elected to the new parliament. He said the MPs of the former parliament, which were meeting once again, "don't want to abandon power." 
"The revolution was made by [only] 5,000 people," he said, and added that he and his allies could organize at least five times as many.
"It all happen so fast, we don't even know if we can call it a revolution," Felix Kulov, newly appointed head of security ministries, told . "We still haven't figured out what happened. People just ran into the White House and the president fled the country. It was not planned. It was not a revolution. But now we have to take control somehow."
Protesters meet with Bakiyev.
Hundreds of protesters rushed into the Kyrgyz parliament demanding a meeting with acting President on Saturday, according to a RIA Novosti correspondent. 
They demanded that the newly elected parliament be declared illegitimate. Bakiyev promised that he'd settle the matter within two weeks, and the protesters were reportedly not satisfied by his assurances.
Eight of ten members of the Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to acknowledge the protested results of the last election as legitimate. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court declared the election results annulled.
"The decision of the Supreme Court is illegal as it was made under pressure of the crowd. After the announcement of the registration results the Central Election Commission can hold a session, for instance, tomorrow," a newly elected MP, Alisher Sabirov, told RIA Novosti. 
On Saturday the upper house of the former parliament said it would preserve its authorities before the June 26 presidential elections and did not acknowledge the new parliament.
Leaders of key political structures signed a compromise memorandum on the March 25. The memorandum states that the former parliament will continue to serve until April 14. After that, the new parliament will take over.
However, quite a few MPs are doubting the legitimacy of the March 25 memorandum. They are demanding that the former, two-house parliament's tenure be extended. The more radical MPs are demanding that the new parliament, or "imposters," must leave the parliament building. They contend that the memorandum must be revised.
The lower house of parliament is also rumored to be discussing the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, behind closed doors.
Bakiyev appoints new ministers.
, who was elected both acting president and prime minister, also appointed new ministers on Friday. Among the newly-appointed ministers are Myktybek Abdyldayev, former chief prosecutor who had been fired by deposed president on Wednesday, as interior minister, Felix Kulov as minister of security, and Rosa Otunbayeva as minister of foreign affairs.
The ministers were appointed as acting ministers and thus did not need the approval of the upper house of parliament.
The former parliament also scheduled Kyrgyz presidential elections for June 26. This announcement was met by MPs with applause. 
"I think I should run in the presidential elections. God willing, I will," Bakiyev said.
Adding to the uncertainty, deposed president Askar Akayev has said that he has not resigned and intends to return to the country. However, Bakiyev and Kulov both said that there were no grounds for impeaching or persecuting Akayev.
"The vote of no confidence takes place in case of high treason or after initiation of criminal proceedings. So far, we have no evidence of either," Kulov said in an interview on national television.
"I have no intention of persecuting Askar Akayev. He has done much for democracy and building a sovereign Kyrgyzstan," Bakiyev told reporters.
Bakiyev reportedly met with the ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and discussed the situation with Russian President over the telephone. Putin reportedly offered the county Russia's help.
Bakiyev appealed to the staff of deposed President Akayev and Prime Minister Tanayev's offices to report back to work. "We must re-establish order in the White House," Bakiyev said.

Conservatives plan to reject budget over newly introduced Kyoto amendment in Canada

The Canadian Conservative Party plans to reject the federal budget. A recently amended provision allowing the government to control greenhouse gas emissions is "completely unacceptable," says its leader Stephen Harper.
Harper said Thursday his party plans to vote against the omnibus budget bill if it includes the amendment to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It would add greenhouse gas emissions to the list of controlled substances, allowing the Canadian government to regulate those emissions, he contends. "This is an attempt by the government to get unlimited power to impose multimillion-dollar fines on any basis, without any parliamentary approval or discussion, whatsoever." Harper said.
The controversial amendment was introduced after a lengthy cabinet debate between Finance Minister Ralph Goodale and others.
When the budget was tabled last month, Harper initially said his party would support the bill. He now says the party will oppose it unless the Liberal government removes the amendment. Environment Minister Stéphane Dion, who is attempting to have a $10 million Kyoto implementation plan in place by April 4, said he would be "very, very pleased" to fight an election over climate change.
The NDP and Bloc Québécois have both said they will oppose the bill. The Liberal Party of Canada has 133 seats, so its defeat seems certain if all four parties hold their positions.
Both the NDP and the Bloc also accuse the Liberal party of trying to tack the Kyoto amendment onto the bill without sufficient debate.
Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said that he was not satisfied with a number of provisions in the bill. “First of all it's not enough on Kyoto. We don't know the plan, we didn't discuss the plan," Duceppe said. “I'm ready to have an election any time if this is what they want."
NDP leader, Jack Layton, said "The Liberals are playing games with the environment. Paul Martin doesn't care about the Kyoto plan. He cares about playing politics and that is what's going on here."
It will be up to Prime Minister Paul Martin whether a defeat triggers an election.

Massive star cluster found in Milky Way

European astronomers discovered a very young and huge star cluster within our Milky Way galaxy using European Southern Observatory telescopes. The discovery was made at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.
Hidden behind a veil of dust and gas, the super star cluster, known as Westerlund 1, is
1000 times closer than any other known clusters. These Super star clusters were previously known to exist as pairs or groups of interacting galaxies located at immense intergalactic distances. It is so close--within 10,000 light years--scientists will be able to examine its structure in detail. Until now, super clusters were far too distant for individual
stars to be distinguished.
Initial observations have led scientists to conclude the group contains at least 100,000 times the mass of the Sun, with some single stars shining with a power of 1,000,000 suns and 2000 times larger than our own. All the stars are in a region less than six light years across.
The existence of Westerlund 1's has been known since 1961. Discovered by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund while in Australia, the cluster is located in the Southern constellation Ara (the Altar). It was a dimming factor of more than 100,000 caused by the gas and dust between us and the cluster that prevented the actual structure and nature of the phenomenon to be determined.
Using a variety of instruments, including the Wide Field Imager (WFI)
attached to a 2.2 meter scope and the Superb-Seeing Imager 2 (SuSI2) camera
on the ESO 3.5 meter New Technology Telescope
(NTT), 200 cluster member stars were identified. These and other
observations have revealed the cluster contains young stars on the
order of 30-40 times more massive than our own Sun. The age range has been
determined at 3.5 to five million years old, making this cluster very young
compared to the Galaxy itself at around 13.5 billion years.
The research will appear in the leading research journal "Astronomy and Astrophysics", and is titled "On the massive stellar population of the Super Star Cluster
Westerlund 1", by J.S. Clark and colleagues. A second paper, "Further
Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1", by Ignacio
Negueruela and Simon Clark will also be published in the same journal.

The Mozilla Foundation released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser Firefox. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or "freezing" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.
The flaw was discovered and reported by "Internet Security Systems, Inc". The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States. 
Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, "[because] Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug."
The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.
The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, "illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product," according to Hoffman. "...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation," he added.
Users can download the update at no charge, and can find additional information at the Mozilla website.

Lebanon yields to opposition tide

A late night car bomb explosion on Saturday in Beirut wounded 5 people and sparked a large fire in an industrial suburb east of the city. This marks the second car bombing inside a week's time in the Lebanon capital’s anti-Syrian vicinities.
The blast added an exclamation point to the sudden policy shift by Lebanon's top leadership.
In an announcement earlier Saturday, Foreign Minister Mahmoud Hamoud said to reporters, "Lebanon agrees to the creation of an international commission of inquiry if the [UN] Security Council takes such a decision to uncover the truth in the assassination of Rafiq Hariri". The statement came after a joint meeting in Beirut with UN ambassadors from Britain, China and Russia. Further meetings with UN envoys from France and the United States are being sought.
Opposition government pressure, spearheaded by Druze chieftain Walid Jumblatt, called for the removal of all Lebanese security chiefs earlier that day. Urging for their resignations, Jumblatt said, “It is not possible to carry out a just, serious, clear and transparent investigation if the heads of the agencies remain in their place.”
Lebanon’s pro-Syrian government originally rejected a UN Security Council report issued Thursday that found, "[security services] has neither the capacity nor the commitment to reach a satisfactory and credible conclusion" in the bombing assassination of the anti-Syrian former prime minster Rafiq Hariri. The UN investigation complained they could not conduct it more thoroughly, partly due to lack of cooperation from Lebanon’s security services. The UN report bolsters Jumblatt claims these services are staffed by pro-Syrian agents and are the source of the car bombings and other lawlessness.
The Hariri assassination on Feb 14 was the galvanizing force that spurred opposition government groups to street protests and rallies. The capital has since been beset with protesting groups both for, and against, the Syrian presence in Lebanon. A recent rally was estimated to have numbered a million people.
In the face of these events and UN pressure, the Syrian capital of Damascus agreed to have its forces leave Lebanon. The Syrians have completed the first phase of its previously announced two-stage withdrawal. A meeting is planned for early April where a Lebanese-Syrian military committee will discuss the how the second stage will be conducted. The goal is for complete withdrawal before national elections scheduled for May.
The worry is that Lebanon may be so far diminished in the vacuum created by the Syrian exit, the country may plunge into chaos.

Guards uncover 600-foot escape tunnel at US prison in Iraq

US troops guarding Camp Bucca in southern Iraq have apparently foiled an escape plan by uncovering a 600 ft of escape tunnel leading from the sprawling, 6,000+ person, detention center. The tunnel had apparently not been used, and officials were uncertain how long detainees had been working on it. No information has been given regarding any prisoners who may have been responsible for the effort.
A number of such tunnels had been found before, but none of this scale or quality.
"We were very close to a very bad thing," said Major General William Brandenburg, US commander of detainee operations in Iraq.
The prisoners may have planned to make their move under cover of dense fog that often rolls in from the Persian Gulf.
"There was a good chance they would have got out of the camp," he said.
Extending from beneath the floorboards of a detainee tent to the exterior of the camp, and dug using shovels fashioned from thick poles, canvas, pieces of metal and rope from the tents, the tunnel was buried between 12 to 16 feet underground over its 600 ft length, and around 3ft wide. Dirt had been removed using a cut-open, five-gallon water jug, according to Lt. Col. Guy Rudisill, speaking for the detainee system.
Colonel Rudisill said the guards had begun searching for underground escape passages after finding a 300 ft tunnel last week. They then noticed dirt in latrines and piles of dirt by the camp perimeter.
The facility, with 6,049 prisoners, is twice as large as the notorious Abu Ghraib in Baghdad and holds nearly two-thirds of all those detained in Iraq.

New Kyrgyz election scheduled after lightning coup

Ignoring ousted president Askar Akayev's refusal to resign, the former, pre-election, Kyrgyzstan parliament has scheduled a new presidential election for June 26. Acting President Kurmanbek Bakiyev said he would run in the election.
Meanwhile, former interior minister Keneshbek Dushebayev, who was ousted along with Akayev, announced today he was leading thousands of counterdemonstrators from Akayev's native area of Kemin toward the capital of Bishkek, to protest Thursday's coup, which also began with a group of a few thousand young demonstrators, who in a few hours broke through the lines of guards protecting the presidential headquarters and effectively unseated President Akayev, ending his 14 years in power. It was unclear as night fell whether Dushebayev's march had succeeded in making its way to the capital, but the new leadership which seized power on Thursday following the protests said that it was maintaining control of the country, and that the march had fizzled out.
Bakiyev switched the venue of a news conference today, reportedly because of a rumoured assassination plot. Bishkek was calm compared to the looting and chaos that followed on the heels of the Thursday protests and coup, but bands of looters still roamed the city and government officials were taking no chances. According to an eyewitness AP report, residents of the capital are still "frightened and shocked." 
It is not clear where Akayev is right now; the Interfax News Agency, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier that he has arrived in Russia. Bakiyev has criticized Akayev for fleeing the country in its time of need, and maintains that he is surprised by the speed of recent events. 
"It didn’t enter my head that this could happen," Bakiyev said, according to a Reuters report.

Canadian union, railway reach last minute accord

, 
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and Canada National Railway (CN) have worked out a tentative agreement, avoiding a walkout scheduled for midnight on the 26th by 604 workers.
The previous contract expired 31 December 2003, and the union notified CN of their intent to strike 23 March. The IBEW members covered under the contract maintain the track signals, and radio and data networks which monitor the movement of trains.
Federal mediators helped facilitate the agreement, invited by both the union and company. Montreal-based CN announced the four-year deal via a Business-wire release, but withheld the terms of the agreement pending a ratification vote, but did say the agreement is retroactive to 1 January 2004.
CN resumed talks earlier in March with 1,750 engineers after the union and company agreed possible work stoppages would be after 12 May 2005. Track maintenance workers signed a 4-year contract deal with CN in February, as well as a tentative settlement with conductors, yard service employees and traffic co-ordinators. In 2004 a 28-day strike by 5,000 clerical and cargo terminal workers cost the company an estimate CA$24 million.

Risk of major US shipyard Bath Iron Works closure termed &quot;substantial&quot; by Maine Congressman

Maine Representative Tom Allen told the "Kennebec Journal" last week there was a "substantial risk" of three major military bases in Maine being closed by President Bush's Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Nine nominees by the commission will be required to submit recommendations for base closures in May of 2005. The three bases in Maine are Bath Iron Works, the Portland Naval Shipyard, and the Brunswick Naval Air Station. Between the three stations, they employ 16,000 workers.
Representative Allen's comments took place in an interview with the "Kennebec Journal". His remarks were misinterpreted as suggesting there was a "good chance" some bases would close. The "Portland Press Herald", which ran the story using "Blethen Maine News Service" as their source, later admitted that "he did not say they had a 'good chance' of being closed." Allen did not disagree with his characterization of "substantial risk" to the bases, but he insisted his comments were not meant to be predictive.
Bath Iron Works is the largest single-site employer in Maine, with 6400 employees. The shipbuilding yard is situated on the western shore of the Kennebec River in Bath, Maine, where the General Dynamics subsidiary has been building ships for 120 years. Bath Iron Works is one of two yards in the US that build surface vessels, such as the new DDX class of destroyers for the US military, according to "WCSH 6 News" in Portland. The second is Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi.

Wendy's sales down in Northern California

Customers are staying away in droves from Northern California Wendy's restaurants, after a Las Vegas woman found a finger in a bowl of chili at the establishment.
Restaurant owners are reporting to company headquarters that sales are down since the incident.
"It is an isolated incident. However, it is dramatically affecting sales in that market," said Wendy's spokesman Denny Lynch.
Investigators are still planning to look for the owner of the finger.
"Nobody's claimed it yet," said Capt. Bob Dixon, of the Santa Clara County coroner's office.
Industry analyst Peter Oakes told "Associated Press" that there should not be a long-term impact to Wendy's business.
"To me, the yardstick here is whether the single incident prompts the consumer to lose confidence in the brand. It's understandable to see some kind of knee-jerk reaction," Oakes said.
The stock market was closed for the Good Friday holiday, so traders have not weighed in on the stock yet. Wendy's International, Inc. (WEN) closed at US$39.43 on Thursday.

Chili finger may have been raw

Investigators are no longer certain if the finger found in a bowl of Wendy's chili at a San Jose, California outlet last week was cooked or raw.
"We're still going to have to sit down with our crime lab experts and see if there's a test that can determine that," said Sheriff's Office Captain Bob Dixon.
Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, Santa Clara County's health officer, told the "San Francisco Chronicle", "The possibilities are still all out there on where and when it came into the chili."
Investigators are working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to track down the suppliers of the ingredients used to make the chili, which included beef, beans, celery, onions, and green peppers.
Denny Lynch, a Wendy's spokesman, admitted that the Wendy's location at 1405 Monterey Highway had no security cameras, so they were unable to determine from video if an employee had been involved with the incident.
Anna Ayala, the 39-year-old woman who found the finger, has returned to Las Vegas.
"I don't want to talk about it," she said. Ayala refused to say whether or not she had plans to sue Wendy's over the incident. "At this time, I don't know. At this time, I want to be left alone," said Ayala.
Dr. Fenstersheib said that even if the finger was still raw when Ayala bit into it, the risk was low that she would have become infected with anything. However, he advised that Ayala should undergo a series of precautionary follow-up tests.

Togo opposition wants election delayed

The opposition parties in Togo held a demonstration on Saturday to demand a delay in the upcoming elections. The elections to replace the deceased ruler, Gnassingbé Eyadéma, are scheduled to be held on April 24, 2005.
The elections were scheduled after an outpouring of international criticism about the army's installment of the late president's son as the country's new leader. The son, Faure Gnassingbé, initially circumvented the constitutional process for new elections 60 days after the death of a current president, but announced elections after African and European leaders strongly criticized the move.
The opposition is demanding a delay for the election, because they fear they will not be able to carry out a sufficient campaign. The candidates from the two prominent opposition parties, Emmanuel Bob Akitani and Nicolas Lawson, both registered with the election officials despite the view that elections should be delayed. In a demonstration in the nation's capital, Akitani's supporters cheered as the candidate called for better representation on elected bodies — something the government denies is a problem.
The supporters of the current government also held a rally in the city, shouting "No" to the prospect of delaying elections.

London – The former British prime minister Leonard James Callaghan, the Baron of Cardiff has died at the age of 92, just a day before his ninety-third birthday. He died at his home in East Sussex, leaving two daughters and a son. His wife, Audrey, died just eleven days ago. 
James Callaghan was prime minister from 1976-79 before Margaret Thatcher became prime minster in 1979 after the surprise resignation of Harold Wilson. His premiership could be considered to include some of the bleakest times for Britain, since he was Prime Minister during the 1978-79 winter of discontent, when there were numerous strikes. However, his proudest achievement was the introduction of cat's eyes in Britain's roads when he was transport secretary.
Tributes including the prime minster Tony Blair saying he was a "giant" of the Labour movement. Former rival and prime minister Margaret Thatcher said he was a "formidable opponent". Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said he was "mourned throughout the world" and "It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945, and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots."

Five wounded, two killed in Lebanon blast

A large explosion rocked an industrial area in the largely Christian area of Bawshriyeh, east of the Lebanese capital of Beirut. The blast occurred at approximately 21:30 local time on Saturday. It is believed that five people have been wounded, two have died, and that three buildings were set ablaze.
An unnamed Lebanese security source stated that a car rigged with explosives was the cause of the explosion. No group has of yet claimed responsibility.
This is the third blast to have targeted Lebanese Christians in a little over a week, and the anti-Syrian opposition representatives were quick to blame Syrian-backed elements. Opposition leader Walid Jumblatt told Lebanese television channel LBC, "They will use all means to try to destroy national accord. It is true that today they are targeting Christian areas but before that they targeted Hariri."
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in February after a car-bomb attacked his convoy. Hariri had been a vocal critic of the Syrian presence in Lebanon. The attack intensified internal and international pressure on Damascus for a withdrawal of Syrian forces. There had been around 14,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon.

Bobby Fischer sues US Government from new Icelandic home

Chess prodigy and former world champion, Bobby Fischer, arrived by jet Thursday in Iceland after being released from prison in Japan the day before. Jailed 9 months in Japan for traveling without a valid passport, and dogged by a U.S. felony charge for violating a government sanction, the 62 year old eccentric chess genius was just last week granted Icelandic citizenship based on humanitarian grounds.
In a first order of business to clear Fischer's way into Iceland, a lawsuit was filed by his lawyer where he alleges the U.S. government conspired to have him arrested, and that his right to "due process" was violated by not providing him notice of the revocation of his passport.
Describing his detention as “…harsh conditions, amounting to torture,” Fischer said he was “kidnapped” by U.S. President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
The U.S. refuses to acknowledge Fischer’s status as citizen of Iceland, but the lawsuit blocks his deportation to the U.S. until the legal matter is resolved. Iceland does have an extradition treaty with the U.S., meaning Fischer’s troubles are far from over now. If deported to the U.S., the felony charge he faces could carry a maximum 10 year sentence.
The U.S. charges Fischer with violating government sanctions 13 years ago against Yugoslavia. He traveled to Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, for a 1992 rematch against Boris Spassky, a Russian chess king, who Fischer defeated in 1972 to become world champion in a famous showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland.
During his flight to a stop-over in Copenhagen while en route to Iceland, Fischer conducted an interview with "AP Television News" on board. "Bush does not respect law," he told the "AP". "It's like in the comics, like Billy Batson used to say 'Shazam!' and he becomes Captain Marvel. He (Bush) just says 'Enemy Combatant! Now you have no legal rights.' It's a farce," he said. "This is absolutely cooked up between Bush and Koizumi."
Very opinionated, but normally less outspoken, Fischer’s verbal attacks express outrage over the treatment he is receiving.

Seven members of a church were killed by Terry Ratzmann, age 44, in Brookfield, Wisconsin March 12. After shooting eleven people, Ratzmann fatally shot himself. Four victims died at the scene; three others died at a nearby hospital.
There is no clear motive but police say that Ratzmann, a long-time member of the Protestant Living Church of God, may have been angered by the teachings of church leader, Roderick Meredith. Apparently, Meredith's teachings differed from those Herbert Armstrong, founder of the , of which the Living Church of God is a member. Armstrong died in 1986 and Meredith formed a splinter group of the faith which Raztmann joined shortly thereafter.
Church members said that Ratzmann, described as a loner, had been depressed since he was laid off as an engineering technician in 2002. He had been working occasionally at contract jobs since then and his most recent contract as a computer technician was scheduled to end March 25, a week before the shootings.
Mourners created a make-shift memorial outside the Living Church of God building in remembrance of the seven victims.

Kulov declares newly elected parliament legitimate, Kyrgyz parliamentary conflict deepens

Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary conflict intensified Sunday as Felix Kulov, appointed acting minister of securities by the reconvening former parliament, endorsed the newly elected parliament and threatened to "take measures to arrest" MPs of the former parliament that would not step down peacefully.
"The new parliament is legitimate and the old parliament's term has expired," Kulov, who was freed from prison by protesters following the overrunning of the presidential palace, said.
"According to the law, the new parliament has to start work... There are people whom I don't like in the newly elected parliament, but I am a law-abiding citizen and will obey the new parliament." He said that he had lost an election because of the interference of deposed president Askar Akayev's authorities, "But despite this, I acknowledged my defeat. We're not hicks here, we're members of the UN."
"Your term has expired. You had been elected for five years. A new parliament has to be elected. Whether you like it or not, I will obey its orders," Kulov said to the former MPs. "If you attempt to call people to go on the streets, I will be forced to arrest you; please don't take offence."
His threats were challenged by acting Prosecutor General Azimbek Beknazarov who said, "These are the people who freed you, will you arrest them?" 
Kulov, appearing to apologize for his remarks, responded "I am tired; I apologize for that."
Beknazarov, closely allied with acting Prime Minister and President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, admitted the newly elected parliament was officially recognized. But Alevtina Pronenko, a member of Bakiyev's acting cabinet, said of the situation, "I think that the people will not stand for this." She said the decisions of the former parliament should be considered valid.
"If we can’t agree, we will not avoid a civil war,” Beknazarov said.
The Supreme Court declared the new parliament illegitimate and endorsed the former parliament several days ago on March 24, but the Central Election Commission voted to endorse the new parliament, saying the Supreme Court's decision was illegal.
The OSCE is sending legal and constitutional experts to unravel the parliamentary conflict. The OSCE also rejected the recently declared June 26 election date. "I don't believe this [date] is realistic because it's a very short period of time. There are still a lot of questions unresolved -- constitutional questions," Markus Mueller, the OSCE's envoy to Kyrgyzstan, said. "If it does not become quieter, elections will just add to the instability." Its secretary general, Jan Kubis, arrived in Bishkek on Sunday. Kubis, who was involved in negotiations in the Ukraine last year, met with Bakeyev and other opposition leaders.
Bakiyev said Akayev remained the president under the constitution but ways of removing him as president legally were being examined. He also offered Akayev immunity were he to return to Kyrgyzstan.
Kulov said that he was "too busy" to even think about running in the new election, which Bakayev has said is planning on running in.
Ousted interior minister Keneshbek Dushebayev's announced plans to march on the capital with Akayev supporters did not come to fruition. About 700 protesters supporting Akayev gathered about 50 miles from Bishkek, in Akayev's native area of Kemin, and about 150 of them blocked a main road into the capital before dispersing. They said they did not accept Bakiyev as their leader.
"We have not and will not arrest our political opponents or former officials," Kulov said.

Doctor Who returns as UK Saturday night timeslot lord

After almost a decade off the air, the science fiction television series "Doctor Who" returned with new episodes to BBC airwaves on Saturday night, drawing a large audience.
Starring movie actor Christopher Eccleston, the ninth actor cast to play the Doctor, as the newly reincarnated Time Lord, the new series showed off a bigger budget with expensive special effects and a much darker — and sexier — tone. The new star and series got a blessing from actor Sylvester McCoy, who played the Doctor in the 1980s.
"I am very envious about not being in it. The writing is terrific and the toys they play with are much more sophisticated than they were in my day," McCoy wrote in a column for BBC News. "My only criticism was about the TARDIS. It was far too clean. It needs to look a bit more battered and bruised as if it's been through the odd asteroid or two," he said.
The Doctor's new sidekick is played by Billie Piper, whose marriage to Chris Evans ended during filming.
"We're pleased so many people sat down as a family to watch the return of the Doctor," a spokesperson said. Families apparently sat down in droves. Preliminary ratings figures show "Who" wooing 10.5 million viewers at its peak, or more than 44 percent of all television households in the United Kingdom, for the debut episode. 
This made it the most-watched show of the evening, easily outpacing second-place "Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway" on ITV, which attracted an average of 7.2 million households. 
The series will run for another twelve episodes.
One of the longest-running dramas in British history, "Doctor Who" has been airing sporadically since its debut in 1963. Ironically, the series cancellation in 1989 was due to low ratings.

Australia silent on UN racism committee condemnation

The Australian government has been keeping quiet about a UN committee's repeated criticism of its record on race issues. A report issued over two weeks ago by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has not received comment from the government in the media, and domestic media coverage has been scant, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, and confirmed by a search of news search engine news.google.com.
According to Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) National Director David Cooper before the case was heard by the UN committee, "We fully expect the government is going to deflect it by criticising the UN process."
In fact, this criticism was given in the session, and nothing has been heard from the Australian Federal Government since, on the committee hearing and report.
After reciting a list of Australian anti-racism initiatives, ambassador to the UN Mike Smith, described the 18 committee members' work in the previous session five years ago as "cursory" and "unreasonable". He said they had largely ignored progress being made in Australia, yet displayed "an unquestioning acceptance" of critics of the Government.
Regis de Gouttes of France called Mr Smith "exceptionally rude".
Jose Lindgren Alves of Brazil told him, "As a veteran diplomat, this statement, with its language describing programs and attacks on NGOs, reminds me of the sort of statement from communist bloc countries and Latin American dictatorships that Australia used to condemn."
The committee was positive about a number of improvements in race-related issues in Australia over the five years since its last report. These were,
However the report contained a large number of serious criticisms, and a reminder that the Convention prohibits direct as well as indirect discrimination. Australia was asked to report back on progress on a number of items within one year.

Zimbabwe church leader calls for uprising against Mugabe

A Catholic archbishop in Zimbabwe urged followers to start a non-violent, popular uprising against the country's president, Robert Mugabe. Archbishop Pius Ncube on Sunday told a South African newspaper that he hopes that Mugabe will be ousted in the parliamentary elections that are scheduled for Thursday.
Ncube is an outspoken critic of Mugabe's government. Ncube said, "I hope that people get so disillusioned that they really organise against the government and kick him out by a non-violent, popular, mass uprising". He believes that Thursday's vote will be rigged, ensuring victory for the currently ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF). The government was also recently criticized for implying that supporters of the opposition party will be denied food by the government's food distribution program.
Ncube's statements may be seen by the government as a call for unauthorized protest — a crime in Zimbabwe punishable by up to 20 years in jail. Ncube seems aware of the dangers of protests: "People must be ready even to risk losing their lives; everyone wants to keep safe," he said. The main opposition, Movement for Democratic Change, said that police arrested 200 demonstrators at a rally on Sunday. 
Robert Mugabe has ruled the country since the end of white rule in the country in the 1980s.

The Stanford Cardinal defeated the reigning champion Connecticut Huskies 76-59 in the third round of the women's NCAA basketball tournament. The game was played in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. The Cardinal were led by Pac-10 Freshman and Player of the Year Candice Wiggins with 21 points and Susan King Borchardt with 16 points, including 4 of 5 shooting from 3 point range.
The Cardinal jumped to an early 12-6 lead with strong play from Alaskan senior Azella Perryman, but the Huskies fought back to lead by 6 at halftime. The Huskies sank a 3 point shot with 4 seconds left in the first half to double their lead from 3 to 6.
Stanford started the second half with a 6-0 run against the Huskies, tying the game at 33. Strong play by the Cardinal led to a 64-53 lead with 3:27 remaining. In the waning minutes of the game, the Huskies attempted desperate three-point shots, including one successful attempt by senior Ashley Battle, and fouled Stanford players until the end. With 24 seconds left and down by 15, the Huskies stopped fouling Stanford. Susan King Borchardt put in one last layup with 6 seconds remaining, which produced a "smirk" from Stanford head coach Tara Vanderveer, according to KZSU radio broadcaster Danial Novinson.

China and Taiwan react to &quot;326&quot; rally

Chinese media and former ROC President and spiritual leader of the pro-independence TSU Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) responded on Monday to the massive rally held Saturday in Taipei.
In mainland China, the "China Daily" published an editorial under the headline, "March sets stage for secessionist scheming" in which it labeled the rally as "secessionist scheming" and a "misuse of people power".
"China Daily" said of President Chen that, "his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith. Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong. Unfortunately he has failed to honour his word."
In Taiwan, former President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) asked for the ROC government to follow up on the large turnout with concrete measures.
The "Taipei Times" quoted Lee, "The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival." Lee continued, "It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination."
"That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies," Lee told a symposium. "Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current [cross-strait] problems."
Lee made his remarks at the "Taiwan Advocates" symposium.

IRS goes after eBay sellers

 As the April 15 deadline for U.S. private citizens to file their 2004 income tax returns draws near, the government is reminding sellers on eBay that they may have to report any proceeds from sales on the auction site as taxable income.
This could be a surprise to some of the 135 million registered eBay users who consider trading on San Jose-based auction site to be a non-taxable hobby. Complicating matters, eBay says it doesn't report individual sales figures to the government – users are responsible to report any profits on their own tax returns.
The amount of money traveling through eBay is big business. $33.8 billion worth of merchandise was sold on the site in 2004, up from $5.2 billion in 2000.
Although eBay pays taxes on its share of the sales (5.25 percent cut from each transaction as of Feb. 18), the IRS fears some small businesses are using the site to dodge tax responsibility. Adding to the confusion, some sellers may legally be a taxable business without realizing it.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has a nine-point checklist it uses to determine whether or not a money-making activity is legally a business, which means money made is taxable, or a simple hobby – where it is not taxable. The IRS can consider a person to be a legal "business" even though they never incorporated or claimed to be one.
According to Woodbury, New York-based accountant Bart Fooden in an Associated Press interview, the IRS looks for such things as evidence that the auction seller depends on the eBay sales income to pay for activities other than maintaining the hobby, acts in a businesslike manner when selling on auctions or puts enough time and effort into the eBay activities that there is an obvious intent to make a profit.
But Fooden said in the same interview casual users probably have nothing to worry about. Those cleaning out closets or the garage and selling off junk for less than the original price paid are not turning a profit, so that money is not considered income and is not taxable.

"Radio Pyongyang" said, "countermeasures are underway to prevent an epidemic and stem the spread to other poultry farms". Experts warned that a bird flu epidemic in North Korea would deprive the population of its main source of protein.
Kim Yong-Taek of the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said, "Upon its outbreak on those farms the committee lost no time to take emergency measures and meticulously organised veterinary and anti-epizootic work to prevent its spread to other poultry farms."
According to the state-run media, there have been no human fatalities from this outbreak.

Magnitude 8.7 earthquake hits Northern Sumatra, Indonesia

, 
A magnitude 8.7 earthquake has been reported in northern Sumatra, Indonesia by the U.S. Geological Survey (originally an 8.2 magnitude at 2:37 ET (7:37 GMT) the USGS reclassified it to an 8.7 magnitude). 
Government spokesman Agus Mendrova reported more than 290 deaths on the island of Nias. Hundreds of others were reported trapped in collapsed buildings, including structures weakened by the December 26th earthquake.
A destructive wave was intially feared and many nations issued tsunami warnings. After the quake a USGS instrument near the Cocos Islands recorded a tsunami type wave which the USGS classified as "small." Tsunami warnings were later withdrawn.
The quake occurred at 11:09 ET (16:09 GMT), and is considered a "great" earthquake, the largest of seven grades. This earthquake is also classified as a "shallow" earthquake, occurring within the top 50 kilometres of the Earth's crust. Shallow earthquakes are more likely to cause a tsunami, because as the lower within the surface the earthquake occurs, the less warping of the ocean floor occurs. This earthquake was a thrust quake; the December 26th Indian Ocean quake was considered a megathrust quake.
The U.S. Geological Survey originally estimated the magnitude at 8.2, but Japan's Meteorological Agency measured the quake at magnitude 8.5 and the U.S. Geological Survey later raised its estimate to 8.7. In comparison, last December's earthquake was measured at 8.1 initially by the USGS, before finally being placed within the 9.1 to 9.3 range by scientists in February 2005. 
At 16:29 UTC, an informational Tsunami Bulletin Number 001 was released by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, stating that there is no threat to Pacific coastlines, but warning of the possibility of destructive tsunamis on waters near the earthquake's origin.
There have been numerous reports of persons who have felt the earthquake fleeing their homes to higher ground, and Sri Lanka was under an evacuation order. Residents of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, one of the cities most devastated by the December tsunami, also fled. Since the December 26th earthquake relatively minor tremors have been common however this was reported to be more intense and long-lasting than any aftershock.
Thailand, which was criticized for its failure to alert citizens to tsunami dangers after last December's earthquake, warned about the possibility that a tsunami might hit that nation's southern provinces.

__NOEDITSECTION__
Commander Leroy Chiao (U.S.A.) and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov (Russia), suited in Russian Orlan spacesuits, left the International Space Station on a 4.5 hour long spacewalk to install antennas for the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), inspect and photograph other exterior equipment and launched the Nanosatellite mini-satellite. This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.
At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.
Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite 
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release. 
The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.
The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.
They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.
Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth.

Still, according to reports, thousands of coastal residents near the Indian Ocean were evacuating to higher ground for the night in case the experts were wrong. Reports also say authorities urged islanders near the coast to move at least two kilometres inland.
"It looks like many people have left the coasts. I don’t know exactly how many people but they are moving away from the sea shores to the interior areas," Dr. Unni Krishnan, coordinator for relief agency Action Aid said in an interview with a reporter from "The Scotsman".
Minutes after data from the earthquake started coming in, half-way around the world from Sumatra, an emergency response center kicked into action. The (PTWC) in issued a tsunami alert - advising "immediate action" and evacuation procedures were advised for some coastal areas.
"Authorities in those regions should be aware of this possibility and take immediate action. This action should include evacuation of coasts within 1,000 kilometers of the epicenter and close monitoring to determine the need for evacuation further away," the PTWC alert said.
The PTWC said they did detect a small tsunami that stuck the south of the quake's epicenter. However the PTWC went on to say that if no tsunami activity was observed within three hours of the 4.10pm UTC quake, there was no further danger. That time has passed.

At a news conference intended to be on the Conservatives' childcare policies, Michael Howard's decision to sack Conservative MP Howard Flight has continued to dominate as the ex-Tory deputy chairman's expulsion from the party was the subject of every question.
The affair began when the MP for Arundel and South Downs was recorded as saying that the conservatives' spending cuts of £35bn would 'only be the start' under a Tory Government. This issue has been of particular significance in the run-up to the expected General election on May 5th.
Mr. Flight has resisted his removal from the candidate list, insisting it is the prerogative of the local party members only and not head office. He has taken legal advice as to summoning an emergency general meeting of Arundel and South Downs Conservative Association.
Howard Flight has insisted that he would not stand as an independent candidate.

After facing criticism for being slow to act and initially giving too little after the December 26 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the United States government was quick to act when a massive earthquake hit Indonesia again March 28. U.S. State Department Adam Ereli said under orders of President George W.

"We still have people over there assisting from the first one, and they will be our first line of defense, once we know what kind of damage there is," Pat McCrummen, spokesman for the American Red Cross told the Associated Press.
Although relief officials have been in contact with various governments, no specific pledge amount has been announced (as of 20:51, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)).

Tomorrow will be an historic day in the Republic of Ireland. It will be exactly one year since the initial introduction of the once controversial . The ban, introduced on March 29 2004, made Ireland the first country in world to completely ban smoking in all workplaces.
The idea was initially met with much skepticism by the Irish who traditionally had a worldwide image as a land of drinkers and smokers. However despite this early uncertainty, the ban has been a huge success. Cigarettes sales have fallen by as much as 60% in , with the country's biggest tobacco brand, , reporting an overall drop in sales of 7.5%.

On 3 December 2003, New Zealand passed the which lead it to become the second nation to impose a total ban. Its ban came into effect nine months after Ireland's, on 10 December 2004.

The newly elected and protested Kyrgyz parliament today voted to back opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev as prime minister, as the reconvening former parliament had done days before. The lower house of the former parliament also formally stepped down, although the upper house has not done so yet.
Deposed president Askar Akayev issued a statement from Russia in response, accusing the new leaders of disgracing the country and ruining the economy.
In response to the endorsement, Bakiyev issued a statement acknowledging the newly elected parliament as the legitimate one.
"I can be reproached for saying earlier that the February and March polls were not legitimate. I said so. But in this parliament we have questions to only 15 to 20 constituencies, no one is saying that all deputies have to go," Bakiyev explained.
Speaker of the outgoing lower chamber of the former parliament, Ishenbai Kadyrbekov, said that the decision was "a political, not a legislative decision, made for the sake of stabilizing the situation. ...If needed, the Legislative Assembly may convene again."
Despite the situation, Omurbek Tekebayev, newly elected speaker of the new parliament, told Kyrgyz television that Akayev was still legally the president of the country and should return, if only to complete a formal resignation. "New presidential elections can only be called after talks with Akayev, otherwise it will be another anticonstitutional move," he said.
Opposition leaders have offered Akayev immunity and said that he would not be impeached or otherwise prosecuted if he returned to the country.

Past Jackson abuse claims to be used in court

In what trial watchers say is a blow to Michael Jackson's defense, Judge Rodney Melville ruled Monday to allow the use of past allegations of child molestation in the trial. The decision was reached in deliberations done in the jury's absence. The ruling means that prosecution, led by District Attorney Tom Sneddon, can introduce what it says are 5 cases of prior molestation. 
The prosecution, which originally submitted 10 cases to the deliberations, was ruled able to proceed with 5 due to a 1995 law passed in California. The law, aiming specifically at child molestation and domestic violence cases, is unlike other cases where the prior criminal conduct of the defendant is not permissable in court.
The ruling will allow testimony in cases arising from over 10 years ago. Allegations involving the behavior of Jackson, now aged 46, with boys 10 to 13 years old at the time will be presented. So far, only one boy has agreed to testify. In the other 4 cases, third party witnesses or family members, are planned.
Jackson's defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau jr. worked to have the cases excluded during deliberations. Noting that Macaulay Culkin, of the movie "Home Alone" fame and once frequent visitor of the Jackson's Neverland ranch, in an interview with Larry King has previously and publicly stated "Nothing happened." 
Mesereau promised to make a "mini-case" out of each of the new allegations, which could drag the trial on indefinitely. The "AP" reports him saying, "You can't stop the defense from putting on a full-blown defense and I mean just that."
In 1993, a molestation charge was settled out-of-court for $26m by Jordan Chandler, ending his accusations against Jackson. His mother plans to testify in this trial.
The Defence's argument.
Defence attorney Thomas Mesereau jr.:
"[This evidence would] easily reduce the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence and render an unfair trial."
The Defense have claimed that some of the boys listed would testify to Jackson's innocence and that they are based on third party claims, many of which are after Michael Jackson's money. "How can you just allow a parade of third-party characters to come in without any victims?"
The Prosecution's argument.
Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon has claimed these other cases will show behavior that is "very similar, if not identical" to that which is claimed by Gavin Arvizo.
Michael Jackson has said "None of these stories are true. They are totally fabricated. It's very sad, it's very, very painful. I pray a lot. That's how I deal with it, and I'm a strong person. I'm a warrior, and I know what is inside of me. I'm a fighter, but it's very painful at the end of the day. I'm still human, you know. I'm still a human being, so it does hurt very, very, very much."
Michael Jackson continues to deny 10 counts of abuse and false imprisonment.

On March 17, researchers at University of Ulster, Coleraine in northern Ireland published a report in the scientific journal "Nature" that showed stress was building on the fault near Sumatra and that the risk of a second powerful earthquake was increasing.
The researchers said in the report that in subduction zones, a pair of massive earthquakes relatively close together is not uncommon. The last such incident was 1999 in Duzce, Turkey where a 7.4 magnitude quake was followed by a 7.1 magnitude quake three months later.
In the Nature report, the researchers pointed to evidence suggesting that stresses in the fault near northern Sumatra were significantly higher than those of the 1999 Turkey rupture. The quake that eventually did strike Sumatra was exponentially more massive than the 7.0 to 7.5 magnitude quake the researches suggested in "Nature." But it still was less powerful than the December 2004 quake and did not result in any life-threatening tsunami.

Another arrest in Minnesota school shooting

News spread in the Red Lake community today as funerals for Jeff Weise and three of the nine victims were held that another student was arrested in connection with the school shootings of March 21. Authorities said little officially beyond confirming today's arrest. However, a source with knowledge of the investigation told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that it was Louis Jourdain, 16-year old son of Red Lake Tribal Chairman Floyd Jourdain. It is not known at this time what charges will be laid or what led authorities to the boy but juvenile proceedings have begun in federal court. 
Last Tuesday, investigators had said that Weise had acted alone and his motives were unknown though he suffered from depression and expressed interest in Nazism.

U.S. Supreme Court hears MGM v. Grokster

Oral arguments in the landmark case of "MGM v. Grokster" legal battle were heard before the Supreme Court of the United States March 29. In the case, 28 entertainment companies have joined together to sue , maker of Morpheus software, and Grokster.
A final ruling is expected on the case within a few months. The issue heard before the court was an appeal of prior decisions made since 2001 at the U.S. district court level and from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both of those decisions were in favor of Grokster's right to market its P2P software.
P2P stands for peer-to-peer software, which uses the Internet as a medium for millions of users to distribute digital content, such as music, movies, books, and software, among themselves. By far the majority of the content distributed through this method is without the permission of the copyright holder.
Morpheus is one of the most-popular peer-to-peer software products worldwide. StreamCast also operates MusicCity.com. Lawyers from the EFF Foundation (www.eff.org) are serving as defense counsel in the case.
The result of this case could determine the ultimate fate of P2P software in the U.S., whether it is legal for software companies to produce and sell software that, in the opinion of some, facilitates profit illegally from the trade in copyrighted materials. However, even if illegal in America, such software might still be widely available from international hosts due to technological limitations of enforcing such a ruling. The companies behind this effort are aiming to hold technological innovators legally responsible for infringing uses of their technology.
"About 36 million Americans — or 27 percent of internet users—say they download either music or video files and about half of them have found ways outside of traditional peer-to-peer networks or paid online services to swap their files". As a measure of public opinion on the issue, they stated, "49% of all Americans and 53% of internet users believe that the firms that own and operate file-sharing networks should be deemed responsible for the pirating of music and movie files," according to Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in their most recent survey,
The landmark ' decision of 1984 (') is the most relevant U.S. in this matter (note: the precedent Betamax case supports the legality of P2P netowrks). A decision in the case could either affirm "Betamax", or overturn it. This is the case that essentially created the VCR market in America for distributing movies at home, and so in this modern technologically updated version, there are billions of dollars in future revenues now at stake.

Surgeons reattach boy's three severed limbs

A team of Australian surgeons yesterday reattached both hands and one foot to 10-year-old Perth boy, Terry Vo, after a brick wall which collapsed during a game of basketball fell on him, severing the limbs. The wall gave way while Terry performed a slam-dunk, during a game at a friend's birthday party.
The boy was today awake and smiling, still in some pain but in good spirits and expected to make a full recovery, according to plastic surgeon, Mr Robert Love.
"What we have is parts that are very much alive so the reattached limbs are certainly pink, well perfused and are indeed moving," Mr Love told reporters today.
"The fact that he is moving his fingers, and of course when he wakes up he will move both fingers and toes, is not a surprise," Mr Love had said yesterday.
"The question is more the sensory return that he will get in the hand itself and the fine movements he will have in the fingers and the toes, and that will come with time, hopefully. We will assess that over the next 18 months to two years.
"I'm sure that he'll enjoy a game of basketball in the future."
The weight and force of the collapse, and the sharp brick edges, resulted in the three limbs being cut through about 7cm above the wrists and ankle.
Terry's father Tan said of his only child, the injuries were terrible, "I was scared to look at him, a horrible thing."
The hands and foot were placed in an ice-filled Esky and rushed to hospital with the boy, where three teams of medical experts were assembled, and he was given a blood transfusion after experiencing massive blood loss. Eight hours of complex micro-surgery on Saturday night were followed by a further two hours of skin grafts yesterday.
"What he will lose because it was such a large zone of traumatised skin and muscle and so on, he will lose some of the skin so he'll certainly require lots of further surgery regardless of whether the skin survives," said Mr Love said today.
The boy was kept unconscious under anaesthetic between the two procedures. In an interview yesterday, Mr Love explained why:
"He could have actually been woken up the next day. Because we were intending to take him back to theatre for a second look, to look at the traumatised skin flaps, to close more of his wounds and to do split skin grafting, it was felt the best thing to do would be to keep him stable and to keep him anaesthetised."
Professor Wayne Morrison, director of the respected Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery and head of plastic and hand surgery at Melbourne's St Vincent's Hospital, said he believed the operation to be a world first.

Congressional dems visit to Iraq encourages support of Bush $81B &quot;reconstruction&quot; plan

A visit to 's "" on two separate days last week (March 22 and 24, 2005) has convinced Washington's Democratic senators and representatives that things are going well.
The Senate delegation, led by Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev), visited on Tuesday. The House delegation, led by Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), visited two days later. They all came away from their whirlwind visits with opinions that although conditions were improving there would still be many years of American occupation before Iraq could be a true democracy.
"Although progress has been made, there is a significant way to go until the Iraqis are capable of providing for their security," said Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. She led an eight-member group that included seven Democrats and Republican Rep. (R-Vista) (San Diego County).
The delegations spent their one day in Iraq's Green Zone, the heavily protected area in downtown Baghdad that serves as headquarters for the 150,000 U.S. military forces and diplomats and the Iraqi government. They headed to their other stops in , , and . Security was tight and didn’t allow for any additional travel in the war torn nation.
The sole Republican in the Congressional delegation, Issa, said "I believe it will be a fairly long stay."
Pelosi’s comments echoed Issa, and added "the cost of this war is huge to the American people," citing 1,500 service personnel the Bush administration has admitted were killed in action, and the estimated $500 million-a-day price tag. "The message some of us had for our military leaders and Iraqi leaders is that whatever it takes to transfer security responsibilities should be applied now. It's long overdue," she added.
An emotional trip to Beirut, Lebanon, by the congressional delegation included a visit to the grave of former Prime Minister , who was assassinated in a Feb. 14 bombing that is blamed, but not substantiated, to have been committed by Syrian agents. Darrell Issa, of Lebanese descent, noted "there's a huge permanent group of mourners at his grave, with hundreds of tents set up.'’
Senator Reid stressed the need for continued U.S. support for reconstruction efforts, along with training Iraqi security forces to replace U.S. military personnel and help bolster the Iraqi economy and political structure. "Everyone understands that reconstruction is an important part of the U.S. mission here," he added.
Senate Minority Whip (D-Ill.) agreed: "I believe what we are seeing here is good."
Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), a leading critic of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, seemed upbeat about the future of the new Iraq government. Iraq's future stability "greatly depends on the training of Iraqi security forces."
"We got a very, very upbeat report from the top U.S. military officials,” she added.
All of the delegation seemed to agree that their trip enforced the enormity of the challenge and the financial need to help the Iraqi people. This would require a continued input of American taxpayer dollars and left little doubt that they would line up to support the Bush administration’s proposed new $81 billion dollars (US) in expenditures there.

Sudan preemptively rejects Security Council resolution on war crimes extradition

In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the , Sudan announced today it would reject any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.
Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, "Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese — whether he is a rebel or government official — outside the Sudan: we are totally against it." In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group "Justice and Equality of Movement," said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.
Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.
The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as , and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights.

Israeli parliament rejects disengagement referendum

Israel's parliament, the Knesset, voted against a bill calling for a referendum on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's controversial plan to withdraw Israeli forces and civilians from the Gaza Strip and some parts of the West Bank. The vote passed 72-39, with three abstentions and six absent. The vote removes the last major hurdle for Mr. Sharon to implement the proposed plan, scheduled to start in July.
Mr. Sharon's administration has not yet survived the upcoming vote on the 2005 budget, which takes place on Tuesday. But it has secured the support of the secular Shinui party, so a majority looks likely. Shinui had reservations about the amount of money transferred under the budget to projects organised by ultra-Orthodox parties. Under Israeli law, if the budget fails to pass, new elections must be held. Opponents of the disengagement plan intend to use the budget vote to topple Mr. Sharon's government, and several MK's attacked Shinui for their decision to support the budget.
Mr. Sharon's position sparked a rebellion from his own center-right Likud party, with a significant majority of Likud MKs voting in favour of the bill, including several members of his own cabinet. Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, and Education Minister Limor Livnat all voted in favour of a referendum.

US Transportation Security Administration &quot;made inaccurate statements&quot; about passenger privacy, says Department of Homeland Security report

In a report from the Department of Homeland Security released on Friday, March 25, they allege the US Transportation Security Administration "made inaccurate statements" about its management of personal data belonging to passengers. The report claims, "TSA did not ensure that privacy protections were in place" as it handled data transfers to private contractors for use in the development of a computerized passenger screening application, called CAPPS II. While the report criticizes TSA for its inaccurate statements, it notes the "misstatements were apparently not meant to mischaracterize known facts," but were instead "premised on an incomplete understanding" of the truth.
According to the report, the data at issue described passengers flying on the following airlines: America West Airlines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, and JetBlue Airways. In most of the problematic transfers, the privacy violation occurred by allowing third parties to access passenger data that was not anonymized. In one case, passenger information was made public on the internet through a presentation prepared by Torch Concepts. According to the report, "
Torch Concepts' subsequent efforts to remove the presentation from the internet have failed."
In an "AP" report, "Yahoo! News" notes that TSA announced the launch of its "Secure Flight" system, saying, "Congress has said the agency can't proceed with Secure Flight unless the Government Accountability Office reports that the technology ensures privacy and that the data are protected." The report from the GAO was to be released Monday, March 27, 2005.

China releases 'Human rights report' on U.S.

In response to the United States Department of State issuing its annual "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices", China has issued a contradictory report highlighting human rights abuses in the US, "The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2004".
For the past six years, the People's Republic of China has issued an annual statement on human rights in the US in response to the annual report on China. "Only the Chinese people themselves have the right to comment on the human rights situation in their own country," said Liu Jianchao, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. 
The US State Department, beginning in 1977, issues annual country reviews of its perceptions of the rights records of individual nations, based on the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights". The current report for 2004, released on February 28, 2005, contains candid assessments and detailed criticism of the human rights records of 192 countries, including China. Amnesty International, the international 'watch-dog organization' for human rights, has however criticized this paper as being biased, because it is made by a government which itself is violating human rights on many sectors.
The Chinese response, was released on March 3, 2005. In this report, the Chinese government attempts to deflect criticism of itself by drawing attention to the various publicly documented shortcomings within US society, including statistics on crime, violent death, imprisonment, poverty, rape, child abuse, and racial and sexual discrimination that are an acknowledged and publicly documented part of life in the US.
Amnesty International's 2004 annual report on US human rights in 2003 agrees with many of these claims.
Amnesty is also worried about: severe violations committed by the United States' army outside the countries' borders; the situation of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay; United States' general misbehaviour against international peace; ill-treatment of US immigrants; ill-treatment and excessive use of force by the US law enforcement officials; the US citizens losing civil rights and liberties after the 9/11 attacks; and continued use of death penalty by the state, which is in direct breach with the 3rd article of the United Nations' "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" (the right to life).
Comment by Peter Edidin of "The New York Times", characterized the Chinese report as "a frank indictment [that] draws a picture of America that approaches caricature. But that doesn't mean it won't buttress the negative image of the United States held by its critics around the world."
This ongoing dispute does not capture the entire relationship of US and China on civil rights. Even as both sides trade accusations, the US on March 18, 2005, declined to table a resolution at the UN criticizing China, citing the ongoing improvements that are being made in that country. This is the second time in three years that the US has not submitted such a resolution, which in fact has never passed the UN when it was submitted before.

Cure for cat allergies may be close, with help from some mice

Although they may be unwilling participants, a group of mice are helping solve a long-time conflict between cats and humans. Scientists from (UCLA) and the (NIAID) reported today in the scientific journal that they have developed a technique that will one day lead to a cure for cat allergies.
The scientists have bred mice that were genetically engineered to be allergic to cats, and injected these mice with a special , derived from both cats and humans. Normally, when humans allergic to cats come in contact with a particular feline protein their body releases a that causes the allergic reaction.
The newly developed protein is a fusion of cat protein with a human protein that normally acts as a brake on the . The cat part stimulates an allergic reaction, but the human part suppresses the response and, in the process, resets the immune system.
After being treated with the protein, it took the mice a month to be cured.
According to experts, nearly one in every seven children are allergic to cats. However the scientists who made this discovery feel that their technique may also be adapted to cure other types of allergies, including food allergies. In some populations allergies affect a large number of people — as many as 30% of all adults in , for example.
The new cure is still in development stages, and will need years of animal and human testing before becoming commercially available.

A report released by Allan Gyngell of the Lowy Institute on Monday, revealed many Australians view US to be as dangerous as . It also found that 58 percent of the population had a positive view of the United States. 
The Lowy Institute, established in 2003 with a $30 million endowment from Australian philanthropist , claims it is "an independent, non-partisan think tank."
The report, entitled "Australians speak 2005: public opinion and foreign policy", showed that global warming and nuclear proliferation were greater foreign policy concerns than terrorism and illegal immigration. 70 per cent of Australians were worried about global warming, the report stated, while only 63 per cent were worried about international terrorism. The report also noted most Australians believed improving the global environment should be Australia's number one foreign policy goal.
Mark Wakeham of Greenpeace said, "Clearly Australians understand the warnings from scientists about far better than our governments do. Once again, the community is leading and governments will be pulled into line."
He continued by saying, "Scientists tell us that, to avoid dangerous warming of more than two degrees, we have to cut our greenhouse pollution by at least 60 per cent by 2050. This means moving rapidly and decisively away from dirty coal to clean, renewable sources of energy like solar, wind and energy efficiency."
The Lowy Institute surveyed 1000 randomly selected people to interview for the report.

Upper house of former Kyrgyz parliament steps down, Bakiyev pledges to fight corruption

The upper house of the former Kyrgyz parliament declared it was terminating its work "to stabilize the situation and do away with conflicts" on Tuesday, as the lower house had done a day before.
The decision was signed by 32 of the 45 deputies. "We think we have fulfilled our task, as far as was possible, especially in this time of trials," they said.
Opposition leader and acting President and Prime Minister Kurmanbek Bakiyev, said the deputies "have made a historically correct decision." He called on everyone to accept the new parliament as legitimate "in the interest of the whole nation".
Bakiyev then delivered a 30-minute speech to about 300 civil servants, which was received with complete silence. He told them, "fighting corruption and paying pensions and benefits is our number one priority now."
"We need to deal with the economy ... A huge part of the state system was devoted to the election process. That is not a secret...We have all seen what happens when the executive branch gets involved in elections. I think we will not get into that now ... I think that staff should get back to work," he said.
"Whoever is ... on my staff, if I hear that they got promoted for money or because they are someone's relative, or they belong to particular clan, then this person will be removed immediately," he added.
"We will set up public hotline so that people can complain against corruption," he told them.
Meanwhile, deposed president Askar Akayev's supporters said they would form a party and run a candidate in the presidential poll.
Ousted emergencies minister Timirbek Akmataliyev and interior minister Keshenbek Dyushenbayev said they were forming the Akyikat (Fairness) political party. Akmataliyev said he would run for president in June.
The two called for Akayev to return to Kyrgyzstan and formally resign. "Askar Akayev has to come back to the republic and answer for his actions in front of the people, after which he must immediately resign," Akmataliyev said.

Japan asks &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;

Shortages of beef in Japan prompted consumers to submit a petition with about 1.19 million signatures to Japan's Agriculture Minister Yoshinobu Shimamura on Tuesday. The petition was presented by a group led by Takashi Sakamoto, president of a chain of used book outlets.
Japan has banned imports of U.S. beef for 15 months, citing concerns about mad cow disease after authorities discovered a cow with the disease in the United States.
Japanese health and agriculture ministers said they would ask their country's food safety commission to approve lifting the ban.
"We will ask the commission to decide if resuming U.S. beef imports is safe based on safety measures taken in the U.S.," said health minister Makoto Kanie.
Analyst Kazuhiko Saito says this may cause a delay "until later this year", telling "Bloomberg", "The Commission has been very slow on reviewing domestic mad cow tests and will also be slow to review the U.S. beef import plans."
U.S. lawmakers and diplomats have pressed Japan to re-open their market, and some Washington lawmakers have even threatened Japan with sanctions should beef imports not resume soon. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice brought up the matter earlier this month during her visit to Japan.
So far, the Japan Food Safety Commission has only taken the step of loosening inspection rules, such that mad cow testing is not required for all imported live cattle.
Japan has dealt with 14 cases of mad cow disease of their own.

A lorry spilt thirteen tonnes of raw fish on a road in the small British town of Shaftesbury, Dorset, earlier today.
Crates of iced fish, worth £80,000, apparently burst out the rear doors of the lorry as it climbed a hill.
The BBC reports Dorset Police as saying "It appears as the lorry started its ascent up the hill the load in the rear of the articulated container slipped backwards, probably on the wet floor, and the weight of the fish on the rear doors forced the doors open."
The clean-up was hampered by poor weather conditions as Dorset County Council struggled to use a digger and a second lorry to clear the fish.

Canadian Football League to test Atlantic expansion with exhibition game

The Canadian Football League released details today concerning the June 11 exhibition game dubbed Touchdown Atlantic between the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Huskies Stadium in Halifax, . The game is planned as a gauge for expansion east to an Atlantic city but with ticket prices at $40 and $62.50 (Canadian), CFL commissioner Tom Wright admitted they were considerably more expensive than the average price for other season-ticket holder single games which, he said, is "in the mid to high $20 range".
At the news conference in Halifax, Wright defended the prices as necessary to break-even with the additional costs required to set-up the game and temporarily expand Huskies Stadium from 2 000 to 10 000 seats and comparable to similar, one-time events.
Events Halifax chairman Fred MacGillivray said he is confident that the showcase game will be a success. "I think the general public's reaction to this event will tell the CFL that there are a lot of people in the Maritimes who want to see CFL football and we feel very confident we'll have a full house for that event in June", he told the news conference.
Hamilton head coach Greg Marshall agreed and said he thinks expansion to Halifax is viable. "Halifax is the natural site and it's just a matter of coming up with the facility", he said. "I think there's a lot of interest here and I think there's a lot of interest in the CFL to put a team here."
Events Halifax and the CFL have also set up a number of events surrounding the game including a Friday-night kickoff party, a schools program, open team practices with player autograph opportunities and a pre-game festival.
CFL fans watch with interest how ticket sales will do when they go on sale on April 8 as the league considers expansion in 2008.

California State University, Chico fraternity suspended for making frat house porno flick

The local chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity at California State University, Chico was suspended after members were linked to a pornographic DVD apparently filmed in the club's fraternity house. According to reports, the DVD shows students engaged in various sexual activities with female porn actresses.
The Chico fraternity also has been suspended by the national Phi Kappa Tau organization and Chico State's Interfraternity Council, the student governing body for all fraternities. In addition, the national Interfraternity Council issued a press statement saying it was embarrassed by the Chico group's actions.
The company responsible for making the porno film is -based Shane's World. A spokesman for Shane's World said the Chico fraternity contacted it months ago with the idea of making a sex film in its "College Invasion" series.
The company says it requires all students who participate in its sex films to show proof that they are 18 or older and sign release forms. Shane's World has made five other DVDs at other U.S. universities since 2000.
University officials suspended the local fraternity from being able to participate in school sponsored activities at the rural northern California campus. The school also is investigating whether any illegal activities happened during the porn shoot including underage drinking.

Monday night's Indonesian quake toll appears less than first feared

Although Monday night's quake off Indonesia, at 8.7 on the Richter scale, was one of the ten largest in the past 100 years, the death toll has been relatively few. Damage was also less than expected, and the feared tsunami never eventuated. But 430 are confirmed dead, with aid workers guessing a final toll of 1,000 to 2,000.
Over 270,000 died following last year's December 26, 9.0-Richter quake and tsunami, prompting alarm when such a large quake struck on Monday night. Mass evacuations and alerts turned out to be unnecessary, when the potential hazard of a tidal wave failed to arise.
Initially Indonesian Vice-President Yusuf Kalla put the number of dead at the island of Nias, near the quake's epicentre, at up to 2,000. But officials who flew over the area said the damage could be less than expected.
Indonesian National Coordinating Disaster Relief Agency said only 330 were so far confirmed dead at Nias, with a further 100 coming from another island, Simeuleu, according to the head of the health office in Aceh province, Mulya Hasjmy, and numbers expected to rise as workers further explore the rubble.
The quake occurred offshore, with its centre around 205km west of Sibolga on Sumatra island, and 245km southwest of Sumatran city Medan, about 320km from that of the quake which caused December's tsunami.
Oxfam aid workers at Gunung Sitoli, the main town on Nias, described the scene. "The water system has failed completely and huge holes have been made in the roads," said Alessandra Villas-Boas. "Bodies are being pulled from the rubble as I speak."
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has declared a state of emergency, and is to visit Nias today. The airport there was found to be intact, patients were receiving medical treatment already, and a field hospital was in the process of being erected on mainland.

UN Secretary General Annan cleared of influencing oil-for-food contracts by Volcker report

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has been cleared of wrongdoing in an investigation of charges that he influenced the UN to award aid-screening contracts in Iraq to Swiss company Cotecna Inspection Services, which employed his son Kojo Annan. The investigation was led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who said that the investigation initiated by Kofi Annan should instead have been referred to UN's independent watchdog agency. The report issued was called by the secretary general a "second interim report" in his statement reported in the New Zealand Herald. The commission will issue its final report in the northern hemisphere summer of 2005.
While Kofi Annan was exonerated, two of his staff members, Iqbal Riza and Dileep Nair, were criticized by the report. Riza allegedly shredded documents related to the contracts under investigation after the secretary general ordered that they be retained. The New York Times said that Nair was "faulted for appointing a person to a high-level post with oil-for-food responsibilities who did almost no work on the program".
According to the New York Times, the Secretary General said "I am deeply saddened by the evidence to the contrary that has emerged, and particularly by the fact that my son had failed to cooperate fully with the inquiry". The Guardian reports that Annan's son concealed from his father the fact that Cotecna continued to pay him for 6 years after "he left Cotecna in 1998". It was not clear from the Guardian report why Cotecna was paying Kojo Annan if he had indeed left the company.
Asked whether he planned to step down as Secretary General, as called for by US Republican Senator Norm Coleman, among others, Kofi Annan responded, "Hell, no!" according to Ewen MacAskill of the Guardian, as well as an unattributed Sydney Morning Herald article. Senator Coleman continued to press forward with his criticism of Annan and calls for his resignation despite the report's findings.

Three Romanian journalists abducted in Iraq

Three Romanian journalists were abducted in Baghdad, Iraq shortly after Romanian President Traian Băsescu visited the country to meet with the Romanian troops deployed there. The journalists went missing Monday, and have been identified as reporter Marie Jeanne Ion, cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian. Miscoci and Ion were both from the television station Prima TV, which had been in Baghdad for five days to conduct interviews with Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and interim President Ghazi al-Yawer. Ohanesian was an investigative reporter from the Bucharest-based 'România liberă' newspaper, and was scheduled to return to Romania this weekend.
The three journalists were abducted from a street next to the Flowerland Hotel, in the upscale Jadriya neighborhood, where they were staying. A hotel employee stated that the abduction occurred at approximately 20:30 on Monday. Prima TV also confirmed that it lost contact with the crew at 19:45 on Monday, and that Ion and Miscoci were probably kidnapped by a rebel group from Baghdad's al-Mansur district.
Kidnapping confirmed.
The kidnapping was confirmed as Marie Jeanne Ion made a phone call to the Prima TV newsroom shortly after she was abducted, speaking a mixture of Romanian, English and Arabic. She told her colleagues to call the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad for help. Voices of men, seemingly angry and shouting in Arabic, could be heard in the background. A few minutes later, Ion sent an SMS message from her mobile phone to Prima TV, saying "Help, this is not a joke, we've been kidnapped. Help!"
Dan Dumitru, the news director at Prima TV, told another television station, Realitatea TV, "All I know [is that] they have been taken by force and we can't reach them any more." Ohanesian, the reporter from 'România liberă', could not be contacted, even though his colleagues in Bucharest tried ringing his mobile phone, which was switched off.
Romanian authorities promise action.
President Traian Băsescu, who has just returned from a surprise visit to Iraq, said on Monday night that "All the state structures are on alert and determined to resolve the disappearance of the three journalists." He also said that Romania has sought the help of the US-led coalition authorities in Iraq.
Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu confirmed the kidnapping on Tuesday morning, while on Monday evening he claimed that it was unclear what had happened to the three abducted journalists, and that no-one had contacted the Romanian government or authorities demanding a ransom. He went on to say that the journalists went missing in an upscale district that is only known for low-level crime, and that there is consequently a "ray of hope" that their abduction is not serious. However, Tăriceanu said that a special crisis unit was created inside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to solve the abduction problem. The unit will make use of all necessary state institutions, including Romanian and foreign intelligence agencies.
Abduction could soften Romania's stance on Iraq.
Romania currently has one of the world's largest contingents in Iraq, with more than 800 troops. During his visit to Baghdad on the weekend, President Băsescu said that he does not want to reduce the troop contingent and that Romania "will continue to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization missions in Iraq." Romania also announced that it will be sending 100 troops for peacekeeping purposes soon. This news comes in a time when most other countries in Europe have considered recalling their troops.
Until now, the Romanian presence in Iraq has not been as controversial as in other countries, mainly because no Romanian troops have died in Iraq. However, the abduction of the three journalists, announced on Monday, is expected to result in a decline of public support for the war, especially since 55% of Romanians are opposed to Romania's contribution to the war, after an opinion poll conducted in Bucharest on Monday. This is expect to result in authorities in reducing their plans for a stronger Romanian military presence in Iraq.
Romanian political analyst Stelian Tănase said, "It will be a shock for the public. It is the first time something like this has happened. If Romanian authorities aren't able to free the journalists, it will harm the support that Băsescu enjoys."
French government send their sympathies.
The French authorities were the first government to sent their sympathies to the Romanian people in regards to the abduction of the three journalists. The spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Michel Barnier, said "Romania can be sure of France's understanding." In response to whether Romania and France will collaborate on this case, M. Barnier said, "We will see if there is a request from the Romanian authorities." French journalists have also fallen victim to Iraqi rebels. Florence Aubenas, a French journalist, and her Iraqi guide were kidnapped in January 5 of this year, and have not yet been found.

Laura Bush takes a quick trip to Afghanistan

In a surprise announcement, United States First Lady Laura Bush flew to Afghanistan for a 5-hour stay today. Bush has desired to take this trip for a number of years, but it has been delayed for security reasons. Security is still a concern — the trip was only announced as she was about to depart from Andrews Air Force base near Washington, DC.
Bush told reporters, "I have been so looking forward to going to Afghanistan. When I really realized the plight of the women under the Taliban, I also found that American women really stand in solidarity with the women in Afghanistan." 
Bush would arrive in Kabul on Wednesday, and spend most of her short stay at the Women's Teacher Training Institute learning about education for women in Afghanistan. She also planned to meet with the country's women who run "micro-enterprises" making rugs and scarves. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings came with Bush on this trip.

German retail giant Rewe to open Penny Market stores in Romania

German retail corporation Rewe plans to open several Penny Market discount stores in Romania in the middle of this year. Rewe is mainly interested in opening stores in cities such as Ploieşti, Câmpina, Tecuci, Focşani, Oneşti, Craiova, Caracal, Constanţa, Medgidia, Alexandria and Roşiori de Vede. Most of these cities have populations of below 100,000 people, and Rewe is hoping to take advantage of a market that has not been highly tapped into, since most of Romania's larger cities, such as Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca and Iaşi, already have multiple large supermarkets and discount stores.
Rewe also announced that, over the next few years, it intends to open a total of 50 Penny Market and XXL Mega Stores in Romania. Rewe already operates 14 several highly-successful Billa supermarkets throughout Romania, mainly in large cities, as well as 8 Selgros stores. Rewe has previously made announcements that it wishes to expand its Billa and Selgros brands more extensively. The total value of the company's investment in Romania is around 200 million euro.
Romania is currently going through a retail boom, especially in the supermarket and discount stores area. Large corporations such as Rewe and Carrefour have established very successful branches in Romania, and other retail giants such as Tesco and WalMart have announced their intention to enter the Romanian market, which is the largest in Southeastern Europe.
The "mini MAX discount" company said it would open three stores in Romania, in April-May of this year, in the cities of Slatina, Târgovişte and Urziceni. It plans to open up to 100 stores until the year 2010. Meanwhile, Tengelmann, Rewe's rival, said it would invest 200 million euro in Romania to open 120 supermarkets in the next five years.

Brazilian president defends Chavez and criticizes US

The Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met the leaders of Colombia, Venezuela and Spain, in , 500 km (311 miles) from Caracas, in Venezuela, Tuesday, March 29.
The regional summit aimed to improve the diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela, that had been shaken after the arrest of the member Rodrigo Granda, in December, last year.
The following leaders were present at the meeting: the President of Colombia, ; the Spanish Prime Minister, ; the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; and the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
During the summit, the Brazilian president defended the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and he criticized indirectly the government of the for his opinions in relation to Chávez. According to Lula, South America is capable of taking care of its own problems.
Lula said: "We do not accept defamations against our "companheiros" (comrades). We do not accept insinuations against comrades. Venezuela has the right to be a sovereign country, to take its own decisions". Lula also added that he is not afraid of doing this affirmation in "any place of the world".
The , Donald Rumsfeld, was in Brazil on March 22 and he said that he was very worried about the political situation in Venezuela. Venezuela is buying weapons and warlike material in great quantity and Washington is considering the country a harmful influence in the region. Recently Venezuela announced that it would buy 100,000 AK-47 rifles.
Lula also said:"I believe that Venezuela has the right to be a sovereign country, of making its own decisions and, at the same time, Venezuela does not need to be accused of things that those who are with you know that this is not part of your thought nor of your behavior."
"There is many people talking badly about us in the world", he added.
The Venezuelan President did a calmer speech for the US: "We are not here to cause problems to anybody, for any reason. We were called to form this new geopolitical map, without confrontation with nobody (...) because it is convenient for us and all: it is convenient for the investors, for international businessmen, for national businessmen and for the United States themselves."
Chávez and Lula both denied any involvement between their governments and the FARC guerrilla.
The Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Zapatero said: "This is a meeting for the dialogue and the cooperation between free and democratic nations that want the advance of their people".

Ebner Anivel Rivera-Paz, A leader of the vicious Mara Salvatruchas(MS-13) gang, has issued orders from his prison cell for his followers to teach the American "Minutemen" volunteers a lesson when they begin patrolling the Mexican border tomorrow. 
MS-13 gang members are considered to be America's most violent gang with such acts of barbarism as to "cut off the testicles of their enemies and feed them to their vicious dogs" and "cut the heads off their opponents to play soccer with them". However, such allegations of brutality doesn't seem to frighten the "Minutemen" who are a group of Americans who are organizing more than 1,000 volunteers to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border beginning April 1st. They have been called vigilantes by Presidents Bush and Fox and sometimes sarcastically refer to themselves as "undocumented border patrol agents". James Gilchrist, a Vietnam veteran and spokesman for the minutemen in response to the MS-13 threat; "We're not worried because half of our recruits are retired trained combat soldiers..they(MS-13) are just a bunch of punks."
MS-13 gang now has about 20,000 members nationwide and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has begun to focus on the gang with an initiative they call "Operation Community Shield". The very existence of MS-13 is considered by the Conservative Voice to be a direct consequence of the USA government's 1980's policies in Central America; "the chickens are coming home to roost.Its(MS-13) members are the sons of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries that were forced to flee because of the CIA instigated war during the Reagan Administration that completely destroyed the physical, economic, social, religious and cultural infrastructure of the region. MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles by the offspring of the immigrants for protection."

British computer magazine discovers electricity cost of running computers

British computer magazine "PC Pro" has investigated the electricity costs of running today's computers.
Their investigations showed that an individual could save £250 a year while a medium-sized business could potentially save £5,000 a year by making changes to the way computers and their peripherals are operated.
A CRT monitor uses £150 of electricity over five years; enough to pay for a new low-power LCD monitor. Using a screen saver, rather than turning the monitor off or using many computers' built-in feature to turn monitors off after a period of inactivity, could cost £100 alone in a year.
It was also discovered that turning a single laser printer off overnight and on weekends would save £70 over the life of the printer.
Many others computer users however run 'distributed computing' projects while their computers are idle, such as the '@home' series of projects (including the well-known 'SETI@home').

Taiwan Nationalists leader visits Beijing

A delegation of from the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT, or Nationalist Party), is meeting with Communist Party of China (CPC) officials in Beijing today, led by KMT Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.
"We hope the current crisis can be minimized," Chiang said in Beijing. "After the anti-secession law was enacted we saw reactions and protests," he continued, "The Beijing authorities have likely heard it for themselves but we have also brought the voice of the Taiwanese people with us."
Banquet and meeting.
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China, hosted Chiang at a banquet in Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Chen characterized the delegation's visit as opening "party to party dialogue" and that the visit "has inaugurated the first sign of a dialogue between your Party and our Party."
Wednesday evening, Chen met with the delegation to discuss cross-Straits economic ties. Representatives from numerous other Chinese agencies were also present at the meeting, including the Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce, and the General Administration of Civil Aviation. The meeting discussed the possibility of opening up Taiwan to tourists from the mainland.
Zhu Peikang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the mainland's Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, also welcomed the Nationalist delegation.
Zhu said Chiang's visit was important, and "focused on the common interests of the people on both sides and the promotion of the cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation."
Visit to Nanjing.
Earlier in the day, Chiang was in Nanjing, to lay a wreath at the tomb of his party's founder, Sun Yat-sen. He also signed a guest book at the former Nationalists presidential office with the line, "Icebreaking journey."
"My heart was filled with limitless excitement and deep emotion," Chiang told the "Associated Press". "It was very moving to visit."
Nanjing was the former capital used by the Nationalists before they lost the civil war with the Communists and evacuated to Taiwan in 1949.
Reaction.
In Taiwan, Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, condemned the visit by the Nationalist delegation to the mainland.
"The Chinese strategy is always divide and conquer, and the KMT is playing into China's hands," he told "The New York Times" and "International Herald Tribune" reporters. "It's very odd that they would cooperate with the Communist Party instead of the ruling party here on Taiwan," Wu said.
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau disclosed that the United States is concerned about the Nationalist visit, and that American officials have privately said that Taiwan's political parties should first unify and build a consensus to strengthen their negotiating position with mainland China.

Egyptians protest against President despite ban

Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of cities across Egypt to protest against a possible fifth term of President Hosni Mubarak.
Activists are campaigning to prevent Mubarak from gaining another term after 24 years in power. They are also calling for his son Gamal not to stand in elections in September and also that reforms are made to the country's constitution.
Hundreds of Kifaya ("Enough") protesters were met by thousands of riot police in Cairo and were prevented from reaching the parliament buildings. Protests in Alexandria were called off after security forces sealed off all routes in to the area of the planned protest. People later said that the police allowed a pro-Mubarak rally shortly afterwards.
The security chief of Cairo has stated that the police will no longer tolerate such protests. He is quoted by BBC News as saying "If we are getting to the stage of getting used to violating [the rules], then the principle is that legal regulations must be implemented." Street demonstrations have been illegal since laws were enacted after the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat.
One leader of Kifaya was reported as saying the large deployment of security personnel had turned Cairo into "a military zone".

Entertainment industry rising star Gail Berman was named president of the Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures film and television studios Wednesday. She is scheduled to start in May. Currently Berman heads up the programming division of the U.S. Fox network.
Berman is credited for the major turn-around in the fortunes of the Fox network. Their ratings were at the bottom of the heap of the four major U.S. broadcast networks when she took over programming in 2000. According to the latest Nielsen ratings, Fox is the No. 1 U.S. network in primetime programming, thanks to such hits as "American Idol", real-time suspense drama, "24", and hit teen soap opera, "The O.C.".
In moving from television to the movies, Berman acknowledged to reporters that she faces a challenging learning curve. She replaces outgoing Paramount president, Donald DeLine.

Charlottetown, P.E.I. residents rally to support restaurant

The owners of the Noodle House Restaurant of , Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.), Canada were overwhelmed by community support Tuesday when the restaurant overflowed with customers, cards, flowers, and personal pleas to not leave the province.
According to "CBC News Prince Edward Island", the recent outpouring of support occurred after Tommy and Lina Ko, the restaurant owners, announced they would close the restaurant and leave the province following an incident two weeks ago, when groups of up to 200 teens from two nearby schools surrounded the restaurant, pelting it with snowballs, and threatening the Kos. Charlottetown Police Chief Paul Smith told CBC PEI that his force is ready to take whatever action is necessary to crack down on the behaviour and last week started videotaping over lunchtime when most of the misbehaviour has taken place. Police noted that they have received complaints from other businesses, pedestrians, and drivers in the busy "fast food alley" and intend to seek co-operation from the schools in identifying the main culprits.
However, a CBC PEI story from October, 2002, reported the Kos asking police to do more to stop the littering and other vandalism in the area including having signs smashed, windows broken, and fireworks set off in front of their restaurant. At that time, Deputy Chief Richard Collins told CBC PEI: "You can't have upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 students in and around that area at dinner hour and not expect for some of them to misbehave," but promised to continue patrols and try to teach the students respect of property.
Tommy Ko told CBC News that he was overwhelmed by the support this week and in thanks put on a surprise free buffet, though customers insisted on paying anyway. Nevertheless, after fighting the harassment for some five years, the Kos say they still are not sure they want to stay.

Akayev willing to resign as president of Kyrgyzstan

In an interview broadcast on Russian state-run Channel One television, deposed Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev, when asked whether he was prepared to resign as president, replied, "Of course, of course - if I am given the relevant guarantees and if it is in full accordance with the current legislation."
He added that he had "the desire to help so that the newly elected president is legitimate."
While acting president and prime minister Kurmanbek Bakiyev and former acting minister of securities Felix Kulov have offered him immunity, he said he would only return if parliament offered him "personal safety guarantees."
Bakiyev warned that Akayev's return could "give rise to mass unrest."
In related news, acting minister of securities Felix Kulov has been removed from parliament on his own will, RIA Novosti reported the parliamentary press service as saying.
He was reported as saying that "The set goal has been achieved: the situation in our republic has stabilized."

New York Times finds flight logs that back Canadian's claim of kidnapping by US government

Maher Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, is suing the United States, accusing them of kidnapping him and sending him to Syria, where he was detained and tortured for a year. On Wednesday, "The New York Times" reported that flight logs they have examined appear to support his claims.
They report that records in a database compiled from U.S. Federal Aviation Agency records show that a Gulfstream III jet, tail number N829MG, followed a flight path matching the route he described on October 8. 2002, a day after his deportation order was signed. The flight went from New Jersey to an airport near Washington, then to Maine, Rome, and beyond.
The records also show that the jet made a trip to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where the United States holds hundreds of detainees.
The U.S. Justice Department, in papers filed in a New York court replying to Arar's lawsuit, says the case was not one of rendition, deportation for interrogation abroad, but simply one of deportation. They claim that he was deported to Syria because they had information that he was a member of Al Qaeda. Arar denies this allegation.
Arar was freed from Syrian detainment in October 2003. Syrian officials said they had not been able to find information connecting him to Al Qaeda. The Syrian ambassador to the United States referred to the release as "a gesture of good will toward Canada."
In a telephone interview with The New York Times, after seeing a photograph of the plane and being informed of the path it followed, Arar said "I think that's it. I think you've found the plane that took me."
"The facts we got from Maher right after he was released are now corroborated by public records," Maria LaHood, a lawyer for Arar said. "The more information that comes out, the better for showing that this is an important public issue that can't be kept secret."
A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, Charles Miller, said that the government has no comment on the case. The administration has refused to cooperate with the Canadian inquiry into the case and has asked a judge to dismiss his lawsuits on the grounds that classified information would be revealed if they were allowed to continue.
President Bush has said it is not United States policy to engage in torture or send detainees to countries where they are likely to be tortured.

Pressure building on Myanmar to decline ASEAN chair

Pressure is building on Myanmar to decline next years revolving ASEAN chair due to its human rights record. The US Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, has said that the USA should boycott ASEAN meetings next year if Myanmar takes the chair.
The UN special envoy to Myanmar, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, has backed moves by Malaysian lawmakers earlier this week against Myanmar's chairing, saying "The UN is always on the side of democracy. It supports the principles these people are pushing and these principles are very important for all governments to adhere to,"
“I don’t think there’s any attempt to punish Myanmar but to make them understand ASEAN is guided by certain principles in order to be a member or in order to be leading ASEAN for a certain period,”
Filipino legislators are also following Malaysian lawmakers, and are expected to propose that all member countries adopt a stand on Myanmar when ASEAN legislators meet in an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Manila on April 3.

New Doctor Who quits series, BBC searches for replacement actor

Success may be too much of a good thing for the future of storied BBC series "Doctor Who". After the unexpected popularity of last Saturday's return of the series to BBC airwaves, the star of the show is calling it quits from fears of typecasting.
According to a report from the BBC, actor Christopher Eccleston, who injected a edgier and sexier image onto the title character plans to leave the series once his 13-episode commitment is over later this year. Eccleston told reporters that his last appearance as The Doctor will be for a December Christmas special.
The show, which debuted March 26 after a 16-year hiatus, was the highest-rated television show in the UK that night. With an estimated viewership of about 10.5 million at its peak, more than 44 percent of all television households in the country tuned in to see the new Doctor. "The audience's response for the new Doctor Who has been incredible and I am really proud to be part of it and I hope viewers continue to enjoy the series," Eccleston said in a BBC release. 
But that popularity was a double-edged sword for Eccleston. With roughly half the population seeing him as Doctor Who, he feared that once typecast as a science fiction Time Lord, audiences may not accept him in other roles. At one year, Eccleston will be the shortest-lived Doctor after Paul McGann who starred in the 1996 telemovie.
But the television network airing the show wants more of the crowd pleaser. The BBC has committed to producing a second 13-episode run of the reinvigorated series and says it is in talks with actor David Tennant to take on the role. Tennant is a star of the BBC period drama, "Casanova".
In the announcement of the renewal of "Doctor Who", the BBC did say it re-signed series co-star Billie Piper, who agreed to reprise the role of the Doctor's sidekick for series two.

Dresden city council wants DNA matching for doggy-doo

Councillors at Dresden City Council in Germany would like to match doggy-doo left by pets on the sidewalk and in parks, against a database storing profiles for all of the city's 12,000 registered dogs. Karl Jobig, a politician in Dresden, was surprised when his proposal received a majority vote.
"In this way, Dresden will once again be one of the cleanest cities in Germany," Roland Putzger, the leader of the local council, told "".
DNA from registered dogs would be collected from blood or saliva for the "genetic fingerprinting" service.
's data protection commissioner, Andreas Schurig, ruled that dogs had no rights over their data and could not object to the compulsory tests.
The proposal will be binding if the council passes it by majority vote in May.

Man attempts to foil breathalyzer by eating feces

A man accused of driving under the influence of alcohol stuffed his mouth full of feces in a failed attempt to foil the police breathalyzer.
The man was arrested Sunday by South Simcoe Police after his pickup truck was pulled over on Ontario Provincial Highway 11 in Stroud, Ontario, Canada. On the way to the police station for testing, the 59-year-old vomited, urinated, and defecated in the police cruiser. Sgt. James Buchanan said that upon arriving at the station, the prisoner grabbed a handful of his own waste "and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine".
Nevertheless, the man registered two readings of more than twice the legal blood alcohol limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood in his system. He was charged with impaired driving and driving over the limit and was released on a promise to appear in a Bradford, Ontario court on May 12.

Harvard hosts conference on technological future of news media

Harvard University recently hosted a symposium called "Whose News? Media, Technology and the Common Good" at its Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Held March 3-4 and providing a certain amount of video to be rebroadcast through the web, the event was widely commented on by both bloggers and traditional media.
Among the participants was Richard Sambrook, Director of the BBC World Service and Global News Division, which has taken on the challenge of incorporating the voices of citizen journalists into their news gathering and presentation process. At what he calls the "community level", the BBC is engaging a project called "Digital Storytelling" in which they are assisting and working with individuals in the recording and production of videos that "document their lives and report and cull things of importance to them", which the BBC has then distributed by a variety of means. They are also encouraging participation in issues of citizen concern at the national and international levels.
Some participants such as co-creator of the seminar, Matt Thompson expressed concern over the growing centralization of the ownership of mainstream news media in the hands of a few corporate sponsors, at the same time it incorporates these growing sources of audience information. "I think that people are looking forward to a media that can truly respond to them, even if the...corporate centralization aspects of it in this giant 'Googlezon' entity give many people pause" quoting a MetaFilter.com thread to the effect, "I for one welcome our new Googlezon overlords."
There was some discussion of the traditional media and its engagement with recent issues of national importance. "I think there's been a massive media failure across the board...there's been an institutional failure.", said MediaChannel Executive Editor Danny Schechter in discussing his film, "WMD: Weapons of Mass Distortion". He suggested two basic fixes including "more diversity of perspective...let's have a real debate and discussion" and "don't take everything at face value and check facts and look at perspectives from other countries." He decried what he called "groupthink" in American media and called for "more feisty independent journalists, and more watchdog, less lapdog."
However, some other critics have elsewhere expressed concerns about the actual independence and diversity of webloggers and other non-traditional media as an antidote to perceived media bias. For example, there is often a perceived lack of race or sex diversity among top bloggers. Steven Levy, a senior editor of Newsweek, has recently written a column addressing concerns about the over-representation of white males among top bloggers on the Internet. Technorati.com, a website which describes itself as "the authority on what is happening on the real-time web", maintains a list of the top 100 blogs that was used as the basis for his column. However, others such as Heather Mac Donald at National Review have pointed out that there are no actual barriers to participation to anyone who wishes to engage in blogging, and so such imbalances in representation are probably not the result of personal bias.

Voting in Zimbabwe starts amid accusations of rigged outcome

Elections in Zimbabwe began with both the ruling and opposition parties predicting victory.
Current president Robert Mugabe predicts a "mountainous victory" for his party, the (Zanu-PF). The main opposition — (MDC) claims the election is being rigged, and despite being allowed to freely campaign, the government's intimidation of voters and moves to hurt opposition supporters will prevent the MDC win. 
The government recently withheld food aid from those supporting the MDC, according to a United Nations report. The UN further reports the government dismissed election officials and poll workers suspected of supporting MDC.
Criticism of the government has been loud. Last week, a Catholic archbishop in Zimbabwe urged followers to start a non-violent, popular uprising against Mugabe, and rallies have been common in recent days. The previous elections, which the MDC almost won, were marred by violence and similar allegations of vote-rigging.
More than 5.7 million Zimbabweans are registered to vote, and can cast their ballots at one of the more than 8,000 polling stations.

Terri Schiavo dies

Terri Schiavo died this morning in , Florida, moments after 9 a.m. EST. Thirteen days ago, her feeding tube was removed after courts repeatedly ruled Schiavo would not want to be kept alive in her current state. Schiavo suffered severe brain damage in 1990 after a mysterious cardiac arrest. 
Many news sources allege the cardiac arrest was caused by an eating disorder, while her family maintains she had no eating disorder at all. During the attack, her brain was starved of oxygen for 14 minutes, leading to the death of many of the in her brain and possibly leaving her in a (PVS).
Michael Schiavo argued before the courts that his wife would not want to live for a prolonged period on a feeding tube. In 2001, the tube was removed, but was reinserted two days later after an appeal by Terri's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler. After the Schindler family had all of their appeals rejected, the tube was removed once again in 2003, but reinserted six days later when Governor and the Florida legislature collaborated on a bill, allowing Bush to order the tube reinserted. After the law was overturned in May of 2004, and the Schindler family's numerous appeals were again rejected, the tube was removed on March 18th.
President George W. Bush held a press conference, in part to offer his condolences to the friends and family of Schiavo. The president commended those on both sides of the issue.
An autopsy is planned to be performed in the coming days, which both the Schindler family and Michael Schiavo hope will shed some light on the cause of her brain damage.
Schiavo is survived by her husband, parents and her younger siblings Robert Jr. and Suzanne; she had no children. Schiavo was 41 years old.

Google starts prefetching top search results for Mozilla and Firefox browsers

 
Google engineer Reza Behforooz announced in a Google blog entry on March 30 that search engine Google has enabled "link prefetching" for some of their search results. The "link prefetching" has not been standardized, but it can enable faster page loading of Google search results in Mozilla and Firefox browsers that have the feature enabled.
When Google determines a user has a high likelihood of clicking on a search result, Google inserts a tag into the results they send out in response to a search. Some browsers can then preload that page, so in the event the user does select the page, it loads very quickly.
For example, a Google search for "wikipedia" today by yielded an HTML page with this code included:
codice_1
While not a formal benchmark, in casual testing by , Firefox 1.0.2 loaded the Wikipedia main page in about half the time when the page had been "link prefetched", as opposed to when it had not been. The load times were approximately 1.5 seconds and 3 seconds respectively. Internet Explorer 6.0 loaded the same page in slightly less than 3 seconds.
Users who want to disable prefetching in Firefox can do the following:

Tawfik Tirawi, head of Palestinian Intelligence in the West Bank, resigned Thursday. Fatah officials said he told President Mahmoud Abbas that too little was being done to curb lawlessness in the West Bank and Gaza.
"I cannot work under these conditions," he wrote in a letter of resignation given to Abbas.
He reportedly claims other heads of Palestinian security organizations had not done enough to impose the rule of law Abbas has promised. Abbas himself said some senior Palestinian officials are blocking his reform efforts.
Tirawi is the most senior security official to resign since Abbas' election in January.

EU, Canada impose duties on some US goods in retaliation for Byrd Amendment

The European Union (EU) and Canada announced they will impose a 15% tariff on some United States (U.S.) imports. Permission for the sanctions was granted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) due to the U.S. maintaining a law known as the Byrd Amendment, which gives its companies billions of dollars collected from foreign rivals.
U.S. Congress failed to repeal the four-year-old Byrd Amendment ruled illegal by the WTO in September 2002. The WTO gave the EU and Canada, in addition to Brazil, Japan, India, South Korea and Mexico the right to impose retaliatory tariffs on November 27. The tariffs will take effect May 1.
The retaliatory tariffs will largely affect U.S. paper, clothing and machinery for the EU and live swine, cigarettes and oysters for Canada.
In the 2004 fiscal year, U.S. based Timken received $40 million, and Lancaster Colony Corp. received about $26 million. The EU says that total payouts will rise as high as $1.6 billion in the fiscal year of 2005 unless the law is repealed. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that payouts for the fiscal year of 2006 will reach $1.15 billion.
The European tariffs will collect near $26 million, while the Canadian tariffs will amount to near $11.6 million.
The European Commission, in a statement, said the tariffs were caused by "the continuing failure of the U.S. to bring its legislation into conformity with its international obligations."
According to Canadian Trade Minister Jim Peterson, the tariffs are "a strong message that we are all sending to the U.S. that international rule, those of the WTO, must be respected. We just cannot allow the U.S. to illegally disburse funds that are collected."
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative, Richard Mills, said "We're disappointed that this step is being taken. The U.S. is working to comply with the WTO decision."
Other countries such as Japan and Mexico are considering a similar move.
President Bush has called for congress to repeal the Byrd Amendment since February.

US lowers bar in age discrimination suits

The US Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that plaintiffs bringing lawsuits against employers need not prove the employers intended to discriminate against them on the basis of their age. The ruling lowers the legal bar, over which an employee who felt wronged by an employer must pass, by allowing cases to move forward when explicit evidence is lacking.
The court ruled on the case of police officers in Jackson, Miss. In their 5-3 decision, they found for a group of officers to proceed with damages claiming they were harmed by their department’s salary policy. The findings of the court do not mean the group of officers will necessarily win their lawsuit. Rather, the judges thought their particular case was flimsy, but they ruled the officer’s complaints were on valid grounds to pursue the claim. Therefore, the suit will not be thrown out of Mississippi’s state court as being groundless.
Business interests closely watching the case and fearing worse were reassured by the court stopping far short of supporting the officers’ claims. The Jackson city salary plan was changed to increase the pay of junior level officers by 30% to be competitive with surrounding municipalities and attract recruits.
The more senior level police officers’ age discrimination allegations will probably not be enough to win the suit, but the effect of the new law means employers will need to defend their practices, and cannot summarily get lawsuits dismissed on the basis of allegations being groundless. Legal scholars believe this has importance because it acknowledges some forms of age discrimination in the work place are subtle. With half of US workers in the workforce now over 40, employers will need to be attentive to their practices or find them challenged in court.
The language of the ruling broadens the nation’s existing law found in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act passed in 1967. While lawyers do not expect a great increase in age-bias cases due to the ruling, it does make the path to mounting a case easier. It is notable that corporate policies that do adversely discriminate against older workers are still considered legal if they are formed on reasonable grounds other than age. The law’s effect will not necessarily have employers change their policies, but rather re-think their practices to assure they are fair.

Minutemen gather to patrol US-Mexican border in April

April 1, 2005 
Starting April 1, an organization of volunteers known as the Minuteman Project is planning to begin patrolling a 23-mile stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border in the search for illegal immigrants. The project is described as the "nation's largest neighborhood watch group" by Minuteman field operations director Chris Simcox. 
The goal of the project is to make Americans aware of porous and undefended American borders. Motivated by a concern for illegal drug trafficking, the availability of entry points for potential terrorists, and a lack of effective enforcement of immigration laws by US federal and state officials, the name Minuteman was used in order for the group to portray itself as a "grassroots effort to bring Americans to the defense of their homeland, similar to the way the original Minutemen from Massachusetts (and other U.S. colonies) did in the late 1700s," according to the group's website.
The activities of the Minutemen are protected by legal rights found in the US Constitution, according to various commentators. Says Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, "People are entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights and entitled to assemble...That's why you can't stop the Minutemen from coming even though, from a law enforcement perspective, it's worrisome to have untrained people, potentially armed, performing what should be a law enforcement function." Some of the Minutemen plan to be armed in order to defend themselves in case of aggressive action by potential armed illegal immigrants and those who transport them. The carrying of handguns is allowed under Arizona law and is protected by the Second Amendment.
The Minutemen are not allowed by law to arrest or detain potential illegal immigrants, and any such action is forbidden by the group's organizers. The project's goal is to survey the area using planes and binoculars, and to alert the appropriate authorities and follow suspected illegal immigrants until they are detained. Observers from various groups, most prominently the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), plan to be on hand to monitor the activities of the Minutemen with a view to mounting possible legal challenges against them. 
Critics, such as some Arizona state Hispanic lawmakers, are planning to show up at the public gatherings and press conferences of the Minutemen, in order to raise criticism and present contrary points of view in the public eye about what they believe to be the current state of illegal immigration. Some opponents have also complained that many participants may be motivated by racism or vigilantism; however, the organizers of the Project make a point of emphasizing their lack of participation with separatist or supremacist groups and the racial diversity and inclusiveness of their volunteers.
Illegal immigrants and their public benefits have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months in Arizona, with the passing of Proposition 200 on November 2, 2004 by a margin of 56% of voters in favor. This proposition attempts to prevent illegal immigrants from voting or receiving some government services. The effort to define what benefits they can legally be excluded from is ongoing, for example with the recent failure of HB2264 to pass an Arizona senate committee; the bill would have required some illegal immigrants to pay higher out-of-state rates for college tuition.
Similar efforts to the current Minuteman Project have been organized in the past few years, but with few participants and without notable success. Some local residents were concerned that possible violence could erupt from the presence of additional armed individuals, either among the Minutemen or the illegal immigrants. Others welcomed the presence of the Minutemen, considering them tourists helping the local economy, and appreciating their drawing attention to the perceived lax enforcement of border control by Federal authorities. Their activities are planned to last for about a month.

Maine passes gay rights law

With the stroke of a pen, Gov. John Baldacci of Maine signed into law a gay rights bill that extended legal protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The new law does not legalize same-sex marriage.
Known officially as "LD 1196," the bill's wording adds the term "sexual orientation" to the list of protected classes in the Maine Human Rights Act banning discrimination in employment, housing, education, credit, and public accommodations. The bill was passed by the Maine House of Representatives by a vote of 91-58 Wednesday. The State Senate approved the bill the same day by a vote of 25-10.
Already protected classes under the state's human rights act are gender, age, religion, race, and physical and mental disability. Additional language was added to LD 1196 before it passed clarifying that it would not extend marriage rights to same-sex couples and exempts privately-funded religious groups from having to comply with its provisions. The new law takes effect June 30.
Government official said the new law is needed to send a message. The office of the Maine Attorney General says that the number of hate crimes against gays and lesbians increased by 12 percent in 2003. Baldacci said those figures underscore why the new law is needed.
"This act not only offers essential civil rights, but serves as a welcome," Baldacci said in a press conference after signing the new law. "Our doors are open to all people. This is a proud day for Maine."
But at least one group is organizing to stop the new gay rights law in its tracks. According to reports, the Christian Civic League of Maine has filed initial paperwork to put a voter initiative on the November 2005 general election ballot to overturn the new law.
The group must get at least 50,519 valid signatures from registered voters of the state by a June 28 deadline. Michael Heath, executive director of the group, told the Associated Press that the League has a goal of 70 thousand valid signatures and hopes to raise $2 million to fund a campaign, called a "people's Veto," to repeal the new law.

Wikipedia victim of onslaught of April Fool's jokes

Today Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone with access to the Internet can edit, was the victim of an onslaught of practical jokes, as April Fool's Day kicked in various timezones around the world, at least those parts which follow the Gregorian calendar. It is believed that Wikipedia contributors were kept busy tidying up and removing prank articles and changes made by other Wikipedia contributors, and were expecting to be cleaning up the aftermath for days afterwards.
Pranks.
The most highly visible prank was the 2005 Britannica takeover of Wikimedia encyclopaedia article. Other pranks included:

Zimbabwe election victory for Mugabe

Amid claims of rigging by the opposition party, news reports today from the Zimbabwe capital city of Harare, say current President Robert Mugabe has again clinched a party victory in this round of national elections.
This national election bears similarity to the 2000 election when allegations that Mugabe's dominant political party, the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF), used its position in power to steal the election were widespread. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), who after that election appealed to the nation's courts for justice, appears ready this time to take the argument to the street, possibly sparking violent protests and unrest. The leader urged, "Zimbabweans must defend their right to vote and they must defend their vote."
Past MDC street protests were met violently by Mugabe's regime, and the court system in Zimbabwe is seen as largely supportive of the Zanu-PF agenda.
The Zanu-PF took 55 of the 120 seats in the Zimbabwe Parliament. The MDC took 34 seats. The MDC had received strong support during pre-election rallies and had hoped to gain enough new seats to gain a legislative majority in the parliament. Mugabe, now 81, will appoint another 30 seats, which will ensure his party a majority.
Tsvangirai cites the area of Manyame located near the capital as an example of election rigging. Mugabe's nephew, Patrick Zhawao, the ruling party candidate was declared winner. On Thursday night election officials reported 14,812 votes were counted. Then early Friday morning, the total vote count was reported at 24,000, with Zhawao getting more than 15,000 of the vote.
The over-night voting count inconsistency led him to charge, "The government has fraudulently, once again, betrayed the people," he told reporters at a news briefing.

Bus drivers to strike in Auckland

Stagecoach, Auckland's main busline, may suffer strikes from its workers on Monday. British-owned Stagecoach believes a one day strike has become unavoidable after unions representing over one thousand workers walked out of renewed negotiations yesterday.
Eighty thousand passengers making one hundred and fifty thousand trips in and area from Orewa to Pukekohe will be affected by the proposed industrial action. More strikes are also threatened for the following week.
Company operations director, Warren Fowler said, "They are looking hellbound to have a strike. We have now made four offers or proposals to the combined unions to reach a settlement and avert industrial action, but we just don’t seem to be making any headway - it’s very frustrating."
Unions advocate Gary Froggatt said he is frustrated the different offers represented different ways of dressing up the same amount of money. "They are using the same money - there is no increase in the money they are offering," he said.

Flora springing into Spring in Mid-Atlantic coastal region, USA

Mid-Atlantic Coastal Region,USA
While residents of the northeast U,S, may doubt that Spring is really here judging from the recent cool, damp and rainy weather March has afforded the region, local flora are now springing forth from the winter chill. Throughout the region, outdoor life has begun to burst forth with buds on trees and shrubs alike.
Area forsythia are in full bloom. This common and sturdy shrub can be found all around the region and is used as a source for seasonal flower cuttings suitable for various floral arrangements. The dormant stems of forsythia may be cut and brought inside before they bloom, where they will later flower when placed in a vase filled with water. Once spent, the yellow pedals fall off fairly quickly, usually within a few days.
After months of wintry nakedness, Bradford pears also are entering their blooming season. In summer months while in full foliage, the trees are used as shade trees along city streets. But during spring bloom the resulting mess of dropping flower petals coupled with a spring rain can cover cars parked under such a tree with a sticky mess.
Regional rain fall accumulations for 2005 for January and February were 2 inches less than normal. That deficit was made up during March as the region was repeatedly soaked by rain. As a result, the total accumulation of rainfall for the year now is an inch above normal.

MS-13 gang threatens the Arizona &quot;minutemen&quot;

April 1, 2005 
Ebner Anivel Rivera-Paz, a leader of the vicious Mara Salvatruchas, nicknamed the MS-13 gang, issued orders from his prison cell for his followers to teach the American "Minutemen" volunteers a lesson when they begin patrolling the Mexican border today.
MS-13 gang members, considered by some to be America's most violent gang, is accused of engaging in such acts as cutting off the testicles of their enemies and feeding them to their dogs, and cutting the heads off their opponents to play soccer with. However, such allegations of brutality don't seem to frighten the "Minutemen", a group of more than 1,000 volunteers planning to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border beginning April 1st. They have been called vigilantes by President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox. They sometimes sarcastically refer to themselves as "undocumented border patrol agents". James Gilchrist, a Vietnam veteran and spokesman for the Minutemen, in response to the MS-13 threat said; "We're not worried because half of our recruits are retired trained combat soldiers... they [MS-13] are just a bunch of punks."
The MS-13 gang now has about 20,000 members nationwide. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, nicknamed ICE, began to focus on the gang with an initiative called "Operation Community Shield". The very existence of MS-13 is considered by the "Conservative Voice" to be a direct consequence of the USA government's 1980's policies in Central America; "the chickens are coming home to roost. Its MS-13 members are the sons of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries that were forced to flee because of the CIA instigated war during the Reagan Administration that completely destroyed the physical, economic, social, religious and cultural infrastructure of the region. MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles by the offspring of the immigrants for protection.

Witnesses saw truck &quot;rev up and race&quot; before recent Texas oil refinery blast

Witnesses say a truck was idling near the scene of an explosion at a Texas refinery which killed 15 and injured over 100 others on March 23, according to U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Manager Bill Hoyle.
"Witnesses saw vapor in the area of the truck and observed the engine begin to rev up and race," Hoyle's statement said. "This behavior by a diesel engine indicates the presence of a flammable atmosphere entering the air intake. A driver reported trying to shut off the engine but was unable to do so." Hoyle's statement continued, "There are multiple possible sources of ignition in an operating refinery unit and we have made no determination about the ignition source at this time."
The investigation has been delayed by BP and Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration officials, who are trying to preserve evidence at the site for their investigation. They are also concerned about further injuries from hazards left over from the explosion, such as falling debris and unstable structures. The Environmental Protection Agency also detected in the atmosphere over the plant, which was treated with a layer of foam.
BP has retained control of the plant since the March 23 accident. Police arrived quickly the day of the explosion, but left after the initial emergency was over.
"Our officers could respond over there, but they don't have a clue," Texas City police Sgt. Curtis Pope told the "Houston Chronicle". "The fact is they have chemical and equipment hazards. We don't know the chemicals."

Ted Koppel to step down from 'Nightline'

Ted Koppel announced he plans to quit as host of the 'Nightline' television program after his contract runs out December 4, 2005. 
Executives at ABC are considering canceling the Nightline program after his departure or possibly changing the show to a live, hour-long format.
Nightline has fallen behind in rankings compared with programs such as "Meet the Press" and "Face the Nation". Network news in general is losing ground in recent years to cable news, talk shows and the Internet. Television anchormen who have left in the past several months include Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of CBS. The only other major television anchorman of the past few decades who remains in his chair is Peter Jennings, who has been on ABC's "World News Tonight" since 1982.
Koppel began working for ABC in 1963, serving as a foreign correspondent for the network. He started working for the Nightline program in March 1980. The program, started in 1979, was created to provide nightly news updates on the Iran hostage crisis. 
Koppel is 65 years old and has a daughter named Andrea Koppel, who is the CNN correspondent to the Department of State. He says he has no plans to retire, but he is looking into other projects. Koppel received numerous awards for journalism, including 41 Emmy awards.

Fourth Lebanon bomb rocks shopping mall

Another bomb has exploded late Friday in a shopping center in the Lebanese Christian village of Broummana east of Beirut. Nobody was killed in the blast, but twelve people have been wounded, though not seriously, reports say. Lebanese television pictures showed extensive damage to the area. The explosion is the fourth targeting Lebanon's mainly anti-Syrian Christian population in as many days. The last, on March 27, killed two people and wounded five others.
The explosion happened at about 9:45pm local time, at the 'Rizk Plaza' shopping mall. It is understood from local media that a bomb was placed in the underground parking area below the complex, although there has been no official confirmation from security services. Sources on the ground say that the actual commercial center occupied the ground floor, with upper stories occupied by inhabited apartments.
Located in the Metn range of mountains east of Beirut, Broummana is about half-hour's drive from the capital and is popular with tourists, particularly those from the Gulf states.
Earlier, the pro-Syrian Prime Minister Omar Karami had announced that he would not step down as he had previously announced before. He will instead attempt to form a unity government until the country's elections, due in May. The anti-Syrian opposition had refused to join his government and have instead demanded his resignation.
Lebanon has seen significant political unrest since the assassination of its former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, and the subsequent pullback of Syrian forces stationed in the country.

Violence in Rio ends in 30 deaths

From Thursday through Friday night in a sad spectacle of savagery, 30 innocent men, women and children were killed in Rio De Janeiro by criminals.
The killings occurred randomly at several places around the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. The same death squad of criminals is suspected in all the killings. According to Rio's Public Security Secretary Marcelo Itajiba, outlaw police officers may be responsible for the crimes.
The criminals' actions might be a retaliation against recent arrests of policemen involved in fighting corruption and criminal activity.
In the victims' list released by the police include six children from ages 13 to 16, and three victims older than 50. The remaining were aged 18 to 45. Some of the victims were just walking in the street, 11 were in a snack bar, and one boy was playing pinball when attacked. Other victims were found at random places around the city.
On Wednesday a group of outlaw policemen killed two people, beheading one of them.
The head was hurled in a direction towards the patio of the police station, the 15º Batalhão de Polícia Militar de Caxias, in Rio.

American comedian Mitch Hedberg dies on tour at 37

Stand-up comedian Mitch Hedberg was found dead Wednesday in his hotel room in New Jersey. The comedian, originally from the St. Paul, Minnesota region, was on an east coast tour of the USA. Hedberg started his career in South Florida, and later worked in Seattle.
While the cause of Hedberg's death is yet unconfirmed, Hedberg's performance at a show in Portland, Maine in October 2004 suggested he might have a problem with drug use. According to Steve Kolowich of the "Bowdoin Orient", "Hedberg, who was clearly intoxicated, was falling down all over the stage that night. At one point, he lay down behind the back curtain and told jokes for approximately ten minutes before rolling back into sight. He also asked the audience where the best bar in town was, and invited them to join him there after the show."
According to an "AP" report on KLTV.com, Hedberg's mother, Mary Hedberg, claimed speculation that her son's death was drug-related was "gossip." The same report notes that services will be held in Woodbury, Minnesota on Tuesday, April 5.
Hedberg, a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman, had released two CDs titled "Strategic Grill Locations" and" Mitch All Together". He also directed a movie, "Los Enchiladas!" The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

NATO chief suggested during a recent visit that more help in the troubled nation would be welcome. Australia currently supplies just one soldier to Afghanistan who assists in the clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnance. Up to 150 had at one time been on the ground there after the September 11 attack on the , but were brought home by November 2002.
"We are facing terrorism everywhere and anywhere," Mr Scheffer said. "We are all facing – the NATO alliance, Australia and this region alike – the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We are all faced with the consequences of fragile and failing states."
Defence Minister Robert Hill said a change of role for NATO, set up to counter the perceived threat from the in the , meant Australia was likely to be working more closely with the organisation in the future. NATO now provides security in Afghanistan and trains Iraqi personnel.

SBC teams with Scientific-Atlanta for cable TV rollout in 13 US states

Regional U.S. telephone giant SBC Communications is one step closer to offering cable television to the 18 million households in its 13 state coverage area. The company announced a $195 million contract with Scientific-Atlanta Thursday to provide a video operations center and regional hubs for the new service. Under the brand name, U-verse, the SBC's television rollout is set to launch in 2006 after field trials begin later this year.
The company is seeking the so-called "triple play," where a telecommunications company offers voice, data and video in one bundled package. Local telephone companies like SBC have been losing business to cable TV companies, which have added telephone and Internet services in recent years.
In a slew of recent deals, SBC is looking to stop that trend. Within the past six months it has signed alliances with various technology firms to build out a fiber network to the home strategy. For instance, SBC has a $1.7 billion deal with Alcatel to build out its fiber optic network and a 10-year, $400 million, pact with Microsoft to license its IPTV technology to allow multi-channel television to stream over its Internet backbone.
In most of the U.S. only cable TV companies like Comcast have been able to offer the "triple play" of voice, video and data services. But traditional phone companies like SBC and Verizon have been upgrading their copper wire telephone networks to fiber optic. SBC says it plans to spend billions of dollars to overhaul its telecommunications network, saying the aging and brittle copper wires which were originally laid in the early 1900s do not have enough bandwidth to allow television capability.

Telescope takes first image of planet outside our solar system

"" reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.
Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.
The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the (AIU). "The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain," he told "Space.com" on Friday.
The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our , 70% the size, and is located 400 away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than 's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.
The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot — about 2,000 degrees Kelvin — so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.
The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal "".

At 9.30 am today the Vatican released a statement to give the latest news of the health of the Pope.
In the statement, the condition of the Pope at 7am UTC this morning was described as being "substantially unchanged and therefore very serious". At dawn, he was said to have entered a "compromised state of consciousness".
Last night, the Pope was heard to say several times 'I have looked for you. Now you have come to me. And I thank you.' The statement was an apparent reference to all the young people he met during his pontificate.
Although the Pope is reported to have spoken, many people are unconvinced, following his inability to speak during Easter mass.
In a press conference held this morning, the official Papal spokesperson, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, is reported by "BBC News" as saying "Sometimes it seems as if he were resting with his eyes closed, but when you speak to him, he opens his eyes."

United States helped Kyrgyz pro-democracy programs

Shortly before parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan, an opposition-run newspaper ran photographs of a palace under construction for since-deposed president Askar Akayev. This newspaper received grants from and was printed on a printing press financed by the US government.
The US government itself confirms this. In fact, nearly one year ago in May 2004, Lorne Craner, US Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor revealed:
"We did a project recently... in Kyrgyzstan where there had only ever been one printing press. We funded the operation of another printing press there so that newspapers that were once unable to print day by day -- due to censorship and lacks of facilities -- are now able to print much more often, basically every day now."
Kyrgyzstan became the nation with the highest per-capita foreign assistance level in central Asia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most of the money came from the US, under the FREEDOM Support Act, passed in 1992 to help former Soviet republics in transition. Money ear-marked for Kyrgyz pro-democracy programs totaled about $13.3 million dollars last year.
According to a US State Department statement, the programs receiving the money "focus on improving political processes and accountability of government institutions, strengthening civil society and public advocacy, and supporting independent media."
Akayev, in an interview with RIA Novosti, said that the opposition which had taken over the government in Kyrgyzstan was supported "with financial and technical support from the USA."
As proof, he cited a report which was posted on the Internet and attributed to the US ambassador in Kyrgyzstan. "The scenario was carried out to a tee. In it he writes that president Akayev has to be toppled, removed. And because the country is key, a neighbor of China, with a Russian [military] base, it's necessary to increase influence there."
"The New York Times" described this report as "crudely forged" and Kyrgyzstan's new leaders have pledged to keep both the US and Russian military bases in the country and maintain friendly diplomatic relations with Russia.

Inspectors close Chicago landmark Healthy Food restaurant after finding dead mouse in cooler

Chicago city inspectors closed the landmark Lithuanian restaurant Healthy Food on Thursday, after finding mouse feces on the meat slicer and cutting board, and a dead mouse in the cooler.
The restaurant has operated at 3236 S. Halsted, on the south side of the city in the Bridgeport neighborhood, since the 1930s.
"Wikinews" reporter placed a call to the restaurant to inquire if they were open. The call was answered by a woman who said, "No, we're closed. There's some technical difficulties. I'm sorry. Thank you for calling." A second phone could be heard ringing in the background.
Streets and Sanitation spokesman Matt Smith told the "Chicago Sun-Times", "To reopen, they're going to have to present us with a revamped game plan for not only rodent control but also housekeeping, they'll have to make all the corrections that our inspectors point out," he continued, "and pass a very stringent follow-up inspection."
Patrons have praised the restaurant's sauerkraut soup and other dishes over the years. Before it was closed, the restaurant had a lot of traffic from the nearby Cook County Circuit Court. The restaurant was once voted "Best Ethnic Eastern European Restaurant in Chicago", according to "New City".

Volunteers gather to help patrol Arizona's border with Mexico

Volunteers from across the United States and some foreign countries gathered Friday to start an unofficial border patrol project.
They converged on the town of , Arizona to take part in what organizers call the Minuteman Project. 
Many came with personal firearms, cell phones or walking canes.
Most estimates numbered the group at 400 to 450 people, recruited from the Internet, far less than the 1,300 the organizers had hoped for, but “it was enough to send a message,” according to . , R-.
"The federal government has walked away from this border," he told some volunteers. He gained support and popularity for his stance against illegal immigration, but was characterized as anti-immigration in general.
"We are here to exercise what is a basic American right: free speech and the right to assemble," he said.
Local citizens such as Luis Martinez, a third-generation Tombstone-area resident, were very unhappy with the developments. "They've come here to cause problems -- to fight. Not to solve problems.
"I work in a ranch and all the ranchers use labor from the other side" of the border.
As Martinez fought back tears, he said he wanted to see the throngs leave Tombstone and go home.
During speeches delivered at orientation meetings, Rep. Tancredo was applauded loudly as he dismissed criticism from those who have called the volunteers racists and xenophobes. His fellow [[Republican Party (US)|Republican}}, President , described the group as "vigilantes." Mexican President used the term "cazamigrantes" — immigrant hunters.
Tancredo said: "We are saying to our government, 'Please enforce the law,' That is not a radical idea. That is not a vigilante idea. It is an American concept: the rule of law."
Many of the volunteers, some from as far away as Italy, are bedding down in the nearby Miracle Valley Bible College for about $5 a night. Others are camping on the grounds of the run-down campus, about two miles north of the border.
Opposing sides were on the streets in Tombstone, although it appeared there was little contact or friction. Local, state and federal officers had mobilized in case confrontations arose.
James Gilchrist, a former Marine and a retired accountant from Aliso Viejo, Arizona, who ran the sign-up effort, said he expected more than 1,000 volunteers to help highlight the 30-day effort. The project's goal is to patrol 23 miles of the , watch the border, and report illegal activity to law enforcement officials. 
Many people fear that the project could result in vigilante violence. Organizers hope it causes the U.S. government to increase border patrols.
Tombstone is best known as the site of the 1881 .

3, the 3G mobile phone firm owned by Hong Kong based Hutchison Whampoa has reported pre-tax, pre-exceptional losses of HK$37.5bn (US$4.8bn/€3.7bn) for 2004. This compares with losses of HK$19.6bn (US$2.5/€1.94bn) in 2003 when the company was only in operation for seven months.
Despite the losses, Hutchison Whampoa chairman Li Ka-Shing said "3 achieved substantial business momentum in 2004". The firm now has over eight million customers worldwide, with three million of these in the UK.
3 was the first 3G provider in the UK, ahead of incumbent Vodafone by launching in 2003. Vodafone currently has about 200,000 customers for its 3G service in Britain.

Abbas orders more security reforms, hundreds of security officers to be forced to retire

Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas has ordered hundreds of Palestinian security officers to retire as part of a plan to reform his forces and end continuing lawlessness, a Palestinian official told "Reuters".
The official said that Abbas has ordered the ratification of a law which would effectively force hundreds of security officers from Fatah's older guard to retire early. The Fatah faction is widely seen as corrupt, and Abbas has promised to fight this corruption.
"Hundreds of security men will retire," the official told "Reuters". He also said that the law would take effect next week.
This comes just days after Tawfik Tirawi, head of Palestinian Intelligence in the West Bank, resigned, and Abbas had several security chiefs fired for failing to curb lawlessness in the West Bank and Gaza.
Haj Ismail, head of Palestinian national security in the West Bank, who resigned Friday after Abbas called for his resignation, blamed the government for not stopping violence and lawlessness in Gaza and the West Bank in recent months. Tirawi also said that heads of other security organizations were not doing enough to halt the lawlessness when he retired.

Time for North Americans to spring ahead one hour

The time has come for North Americans to enjoy the extra length of the Northern Hemisphere’s spring and summer day, by observing (DST).
In most areas of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, DST observers should turn their clocks "ahead" one hour at 2 a.m. Sunday morning.
In Canada, the change takes effect in Newfoundland and New Brunswick at 12:01 a.m., and 2 a.m. in most of the rest of the country.
Arizona, Hawaii, the part of Indiana in the Eastern time zone, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa do not change their clocks. Certain areas in Canada also do not observe DST, such as Saskatchewan province. Mexico only started observing DST in 1996, after the North American Free Trade Agreement, to coordinate their times with neighbouring states.
North America isn't the only region observing DST. Many European countries began last week and several countries south of the equator returned to standard time in March as they enter autumn. Other countries continue to discuss whether or not a switch to the system is a good idea. In Israel, a Knesset committee recently decided to begin observing daylight savings on the last Thursday before April 1.
In North America, daylight savings time ends the last Sunday in October.
Safety advocates say this is a good time to change batteries in your smoke detector as well.

World Bank to tighten security belt for Wolfowitz arrival

Despite controversy ignited by the nomination of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank (WB), the 24-member board of directors voted unanimously on Thursday to accept his confirmation. A whirlwind tour by Wolfowitz, who traveled to many capital cities of the bank’s major shareholders and met with voting board members, quieted misgivings over his succession to the incumbent president John Wolfensohn.
Widespread criticism of the Wolfowitz role in the US build-up to war in Iraq heightened levels of security concerns within the bank as they anticipate his arrival. The WB, from the executive level down to memos circulated among departments, express concern for it becoming the target of terrorist attack. The level of seriousness being taken by WB led it to set up cost estimates for improving security.
Wolfowitz will assume leadership in June this year. Despite a belief by some that he acts unilaterally and lacks development experience, a European Commission spokeswoman, speaking for Commissioner Olli Rehn, told a news conference that[Rehn] "was satisfied with everything he heard from Mr Wolfowitz concerning free trade and also on poverty reduction and development policy."
The "Associated Press" quotes the Belgian Development Aid minister saying, "There are no objections of EU countries."
The public display of support belies dissention underneath. "Reuters" reportedly received a confidential email that provided details of a comment line on an internal website for the WB staff who use it from their far flung locations. The feelings about the Wolfowitz nomination received 1,300 responses, mostly about the bank’s reputation and effectiveness under the new leadership.

Catholic Church prepares for papal election conclave

With the death of Roman Catholic pontiff John Paul II, 84, on Friday, the prepares for the conclave, or assembly of cardinals, who will choose the next pope. All under the age of 80 are required to attend and cast their votes at the election, which must be held from 15-20 days following the funeral of the deceased Pontiff.
The papacy, the highest office in the Catholic church, lies vacant until the election of a new leader for the over one billion-strong denomination.
117 cardinals will meet in the Vatican's to conduct the election, beginning on April 18, it was announced today.
This conclave will be the first time in history the cardinals will be allowed to move around the Vatican instead of being isolated in the Sistine Chapel during the elections. However, they are not allowed to receive or send any messages outside Vatican city during the election period. Those who do so will face excommunication.
This will also be the first time that after a full week of voting, two votes each morning, two each afternoon, the required 2/3+1 support can be set aside and a new pope elected by 50%+1 of the cardinals.
At the last conclave, John Paul II was elected after four days.
Thus, the new pope is expected to be known sometime between April 18 and April 25.

Marketing blitz begins for final 'Star Wars' film

With six weeks before the sixth and final "Star Wars" film saga, "Revenge of the Sith", hits theaters worldwide on May 19, the movie studios behind the brand have launched a massive marketing and merchandising campaign. It includes toys aimed at children, collectibles for adults active in fandom and other related merchandise such as science fiction novels based in the Star Wars universe.
The 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm studios make millions of dollars in licensing fees from toy manufacturers and promotional deals with fast-food restaurants, candy and cereal boxes. Even telephone companies are getting into the act. Cingular Wireless will be rolling out a "Star Wars"-themed promotion and handset downloads within the next few days, according to a company spokesman.
Sales from "Star Wars" tie-in merchandise have brought in a lot of money over the years. "Star Wars" toy sales themed with "The Phantom Menace" brought in $500 million. In 2002, "Attack of the Clones" toy sales were $225 million, according to reports.
In January 2003, toymaker Hasbro struck the biggest licensing deal for the brand when it agreed to pay Lucasfilm $200 million in cash and stock for the exclusive rights to make "Star Wars"-themed toys until 2018. That figure does not include Lucasfilm's percentage of the profit from each toy's sale.
Wal-mart and Target, the two largest toy retailers in the U.S. have entire aisles devoted to tie-in "Star Wars" action figures, full-sized mock ups of light sabers and other more whimsical items. Hasbro is even marketing a "Darth Tater" special edition of its classic Mr. Potato Head.
The merchandise also has a literary side. Author Matthew Stover has a monetization of "Revenge of the Sith" as part of a multi-book deal between Lucasfilm and publisher Random House's science fiction specialty label, Del Rey. Stover's book has consistently been in the Top 50-most ordered books, according to Amazon.com. Other "Sith"-themed books released within the past few weeks include coffee table picture books and behind-the-scenes documentation detailing the making of the film.

Speculation abounds on future pope

Speculation is mounting in Rome with Vatican observers suggesting that many factors will go into the decision of who will be John Paul II's successor.
It has long been considered extremely unlikely that the next pope will be an American. Cardinal Francis George of Chicago declared in 2003 that "to some extent, even the appearance of being in some sense captured by, as we say now, the world's only superpower, would not be helpful to the mission of the church." Some say the choice of a French Pope would also be overly controversial.
The Polish-born Karol Wojtyla was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. Though in Catholic tradition, the pope bears the title of Primate of Italy and Archbishop of the Roman Province, or for short, "Bishop of Rome," this does not necessarily mean that he must be Italian, or Roman, as was demonstrated with the election of John Paul. Nonetheless, the rise of a non-Italian pope in 1978 may be followed by a desire to reclaim the chair by Italians.
Italy will be the country with the greatest representation on the conclave, with 20 eligible cardinals. The US trails far behind at 11, and behind them are Spain (6), France (5), and Brazil (4). 
Europe forms the largest bloc with 58 papal electors, while Latin America and Africa have 21 and 11 respectively.
John Paul II was a relatively unknown archbishop at the time of his election, indicating that it is not impossible for church leaders not well known throughout the church across the world to be potential recipients of the office.
Many analysts suggest the strong possibility that the cardinals will seek to avoid electing a young pope in the wake of John Paul's 27-year reign. Age has been a factor in the choice of pontiff during the church's history, and may surface again. The "New York Times" speculates that cardinals may choose a slightly older pope "in order to avoid another long reign," like that of John Paul II. Two well-liked figures, Angelo Scola of Venice, 63, and Christoph Schönborn of Austria, 60, may well be too young to be chosen for the office. Moreover, some feel that an older pope may be selected specifically to serve as a "transitional" figure following the previous lengthy papacy.
Among the most prominent 'papabili,' or likely potentials for the papacy are:
Others include Giovanni Battista Re, 71, president of the Vatican commission for Latin America, and Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels, 71.
Analysts suggest that among the important issues around which the election of the next pontiff will center are candidates' position on socialism and capitalism, other religions or ecumenism, abortion, homosexuality, clerical celibacy, as well as their degree of progressivism or conservatism and relations with the international community.

Two Newcastle football players fight each other, both sent off

Barclaycard Premiership football match between Newcastle United and Aston Villa ended up with a fight between two teammates. Newcastle hasn't lost a single game since January 23 and looked as favourites for their April 2 home match against Aston Villa. However things haven't went as planned. On the 5th minute of the game Juan Pablo Angel scored for the away side. Villa continued to dominate and in the second half any hopes of fightback for Newcastle were shattered as Steven Taylor got sent off for the deliberate handball. The foul warranted a penalty and Gareth Barry scored from the spot. Seven minutes later he did it again, after Stephen Carr brought down Darius Vassell inside the box.
However, it was not a result that disappointed Toon fans the most. Two Newcastle players, Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer, engaged in a fight in the middle of the pitch at the sight of the crowd. Referee Barry Knight made a decision to send both off. After the match, manager Graeme Souness made no excuse for the behavior of the players; however he defended Dyer, as it was Bowyer who started punching him. Both players could be facing 3-match bans by the English Football Association.

The names of nine Australian service personnel who died Saturday in a helicopter crash near the village of Aman Dray on the Indonesian island of have been released by the (ADF). The tragedy is the worst naval flying accident in Australian history.
The lost Lieutenant Mathew Davy and Lieutenant Paul Kimlan from the Australian Capital Territory, Lieutenant Matthew Goodall, Petty Officer Stephen Slattery and Leading Seaman Scott Bennett from New South Wales, and Lieutenant Jonathan King from Queensland.
The lost Squadron Leader Paul McCarthy from Western Australia, Flight Lieutenant Lyn Rowbottom and Sergeant Wendy Jones from Queensland.
The bodies have not yet been removed from the wreckage.
Two other men who were onboard survived the accident are currently being treated for fractures on HMAS Kanimbla, which is stationed just off Nias.
Australian investigators have left for Indonesia to try to determine the cause of the crash. Witnesses who saw the accident, said the helicopter slammed into the ground nose first. People from the local village tried to help pull the two survivors free, but said the aircraft exploded into a fireball within five or ten minutes of impact, hindering the rescue.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu calls for African Pope

NB this story is also covered in the article Desmond Tutu calls for election of African pope
 Archbishop Desmond Tutu today called for the cardinals of the Catholic Church to choose an African pope to succeed the recently deceased Pope John Paul II. The Archbishop said, "I hope the cardinals... will follow the first non-Italian pope by electing the first African pope." (Note: Pope John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the 15th century, but not the first non-Italian pope ever, as Tutu has stated. Additionally, it would not be the first time an African pope has been elected.)
Should such an event occur, it is widely believed that Cardinal Francis Arinze of would be the most likely candidate. The 72 year old "Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship" is known to be theologically conservative but very knowledgeable about the Islamic religion, an important strength given recent hostilities between Christians and Muslims. Arinze was one of the five cardinals chosen by the Pope to sit on the "Committee of the Great Jubilee" in 2000.
If Cardinal Arinze becomes the next Pope, he would be the first African Pope in over 1,500 years - the last being Pope Gelasius I who was the Pontiff from 492 to 496.
However in Nigeria such predictions have been met with mixed responses. A churchgoer in the state of Enugu told the "Reuters" news agency, "I doubt if world politics will allow a black man to be pope."

The protesters are part of a movement to stop Japan from becoming a member of the U.N. Security Council. Chen Tong, editor-in-chief of the "sina.com" web site, says a petition with millions of signatures opposing Japan's appointment to the council will be presented to the U.N. and the Japanese Embassy in Beijing.

Tartan Day festivities April 6 in New York

Tartan Day in the United States is being kicked off with big celebrations in New York, including parades and marching bands. The Grand Marshall of this year's parade was Randall Wallace, a Scottish-American and author of the screenplay for the movie Braveheart.
Week-long festivities were to include the annual "Tunes of Glory" parades, pipe bands from 3 countries, an exhibition called "Scottish Village", and a fashion show on Wednesday called "Dressed to Kilt". One of Scotland's national treasures, William Wallace's sword, left Scotland for the first time in 700 years and was flown to New York for their Tartan Week celebrations of 2005.
Tartan Day was designated as a holiday by the US Senate, "National Tartan Day", in 1998. Support for the holiday first gathered momentum in Canada through the efforts of Ms. Jean Watson in the 1980s. The purpose of the holiday is to remember the contribution of Scots both at home and abroad, raise the profile of Scotland, and encourage tourism and trade. 
The date of April 6 was chosen because the "Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence, was signed on April 6, 1320 and the American Declaration of Independence was modelled on that inspirational document." In Australia and New Zealand, Tartan Day is celebrated on July 1, the anniversary of the repeal of the Act of Proscription in 1782.
President George W. Bush in 2002 wrote a letter to the Scotsman newspaper supporting the annual celebrations, writing, "As you take part in customs that honour the role of Scottish Americans in our history, I join you in celebrating the contributions of these important Americans. This observance renews our appreciation for the diversity and remarkable heritage that unites us all." 
In the US House of Representatives on March 9 last month, seven years after the Senate approval, a voice vote was unanimously taken to declare "National Tartan Day" a national holiday. 
The number of Americans with Scottish or Scotch-Irish ancestry according to the 2000 US Census is about 9.2 million, comprising 3.2% of the US population.

A group from Al Qaeda claimed responsibility today for the Saturday evening prison attack at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. The US military revised casualty reports upward to 44 American soldiers and 12 Iraqi prisoners injured, some seriously.
The attack came at the end of a day that witnessed a series of violent attacks elsewhere throughout the country. Six other people were killed in Iraq yesterday, ending recent hopes that violence may be subsiding.
A Web statement posted by Islamists on Sunday said, "Your brothers in the al Qaeda Organization (for Holy War) in Iraq launched a well-planned attack on Abu Ghraib prison, where Muslim women and men are held." The statement also says, "This battle is part of a series of raids."
The "GNN" reports U.S. Army 1st Lt. Adam Rondeau saying, “This was obviously a very well-organized attack and a very big attack.”
The Abu Ghraib prison, located 18 miles (30 km) west of Baghdad, is still supervised by American forces following the notorious prisoner abuse scandal last year. Approximately 3,300 Iraqi detainees are held there.

Topping the list was the new entrant Hilary Weston with a fortune estimated at over €7.2bn. Weston was excluded in previous lists because the majority of her wealth was made abroad, however a rule change this year allowed the Dublin born model to enter in first place. Mrs Weston, 63, grew up in Ireland and built her modeling career there before becoming wed to Galen Weston, heir to his grandfathers multi-billion euro retailing fortune in Canada.

SIECUS further requested that the site be "immediately taken down and that a formal review of its content and techniques for communication and behavioral learning be launched," in which SIECUS and its related associations would be assisting.
According to the 4parents.gov website, " 4Parents.gov is part of a new national public education campaign to provide parents with the information, tools and skills they need to help their teens make the healthiest choices." Whether this implies that other websites or educational materials will be released in the near future was not made clear.
The site appeared to particularly focus on parent-child communication and the delivery of sex-ed information to parents in order to support that cause. The stated goal of this campaign is improvement of public health through the reduction of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and other health-related issues that affect teens.

Akayev signs resignation agreement

Deposed President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev said that he had signed his resignation in the Kyrgyz embassy in Moscow Sunday. He said an official resignation ceremony would take place Monday.
The signing of his document came after two and a half hours of talks with a delegation from the Kyrgyz parliament, including Speaker Omurbek Tekebayev. Akayev said a resignation document was drawn up during the meeting.
"We have approved a very good and historic document," Akayev said after signing his resignation. It will "pave the way for finding a way of out the political crisis that Kyrgyzstan has found itself in."
Tekebayev said the agreement "will ensure peace and legitimacy."
While full details of the document were not available, Akayev said Russia and Kazakhstan were listed as guarantors. Akayev also said that under the agreement, parliament would pass a resolution recognizing his privileges as a former head of state - namely, immunity from prosecution. He and his family are widely seen as corrupt in Kyrgyzstan.

Lebanese-Syrian meetings reach full withdrawal accord

United Nations envoy Terje Roed-Larsen and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara announced Sunday at a joint news conference that Syria will withdraw all troops and foreign intelligence agents by the April 30 deadline. The withdrawal would precede the upcoming national elections scheduled for May, and would end 25 years of Syrian military occupation in Lebanon.
The news conference came after meetings in between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Lebanese army chief General Michel Suleiman that dealt with the withdrawal timetable. Roed-Larson said, "Syria has agreed that subject to the acceptance of the Lebanese authorities, a U.N. verification team will be dispatched to verify the [full withdrawal]."
The removal of Syrian military presence in Lebanon is a main sticking point of the anti-Syrian, or opposition group, objections towards forming a new government. After a February bombing assassination of the previous Lebanese Prime Minister , who was also anti-Syrian, he was succeeded by . Massive opposition group street protests forced the pro-Syrian Karami to resign, but a week later he was re-installed by President al-Assad to spear-head the new government's formation.
Mr. Karami has been unable to secure opposition group support for forming a new government. The Lebanese Parliament must act soon to form consensus in announcing new elections, or its legal mandate to do so will expire.

NASA prepares to roll orbiter Discovery to launch pad

NASA has announced the planned rollout of the Shuttle Discovery from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to its launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. NASA is preparing the shuttle for its "Return to Flight" mission.
The rollout will take nearly 6 hours to cover the 4 mile stretch from the VAB to Launch Pad 39B and will begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT (04:01 UTC) on April 5. The fully assembled Space Shuttle Vehicle stack (orbiter, External Tank (ET) and twin Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs)) will be mounted on the Mobile Launcher Platform and delivered to the pad.
The Return to Flight mission is the 114th Space Shuttle flight, and the 31st flight of the orbiter Discovery.

Hunter S. Thompson obituary spawns &quot;murder&quot; theory

Hunter Thompson, the author of "Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness", once discussed on radio the possibility that he would be murdered to shut him up — and that it would be made to look like a suicide.
Paul William Roberts, a friend of Thompson and a well known travel writer, in an obituary played on this possibility for dramatic effect. Roberts related the fact that Thompson was working on a story relating to the World Trade Center demolition, and did say he was going to be murdered, and that the murder would be identified as a suicide. Roberts says in the second paragraph that Thompson did, however, commit suicide, and was not murdered. 
Two years ago in January 2003, Thompson actually did give an interview on KDNK radio (Colorado) where he made a suggestion that he may be murdered to shut him up.
"Bush is really the evil one here and it is more than just him. We are the Nazis in this game and I don't like it. I am embarrassed and I am pissed off. I mean to say something. I think a lot of people in this country agree with me...we'll see what happens to me if I get my head cut off next week -- it is always unknown or bushy-haired strangers who commit suicide right afterwards with no witnesses," the writer said.
More confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff's officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; "I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber". This "single bullet" problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.
Speculation arose that the gun used to kill Thompson could have been capable of a manual ammunition cycle, though as yet no support for this claim has been offered. DiSalvo said he hadn't checked the gun, but that the weapon could have been on a manual cycle that would have stopped the other cartridges from going into the chamber.
The spent slug was found in the stove's hood behind Hunter Thompson's body, investigators said.
Thompson died February 20. The county coroner ruled that Thompson's death was a suicide on February 21.
Other friends were not surprised at his death. "I wasn't surprised," said George Stranahan, a former owner of the Woody Creek Tavern, a favourite haunt of Thompson. "I never expected Hunter to die in a hospital bed with tubes coming out of him."
Neighbours have said how his broken leg had prevented him from leaving his house as often as he had liked to.
One neighbour and long-standing friend, Mike Cleverly, said Thompson was clearly hobbled by the broken leg. "Medically speaking, he's had a rotten year."

Venezuela buys more weapons, now from Spain

The Spanish government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has reached an agreement with Venezuela for the sale of 10 C-295 medium transport military airplanes, two CN-235 Persuader maritime vigilance airplanes, and eleven ships, eight of them exclusively for military use.
The total value of the sales is about 1,3 billion euros. The agreement represents the biggest military sale ever made by Spain. 
Several political and Spanish newspapers criticized Zapatero's decision. Mariano Rajoy, PP party leader, labeled the decision "a monstrous mistake". The Spanish newspaper "Diario de Sevilla" editorialized that "the destination of the weapon bought legally on the international market should not fraudulently go to armed, terrorist, and paramilitary groups, etc, that could use them unduly."
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said that "the weapons are not instruments of war but instruments of peace". According to Chávez, the ships will be used to step up Venezuela's coastal patrols against the drug trade.

Among the other issues to be discussed are energy cooperation, which many analysts, however, feel may not be as easy to attain as some hope, given the economic competition between the two rising giants.
These events come at a time when the United States has recently announced its intention to help India, a past rival of China, become a "superpower." India has also been planning military expansion/modernization.

EFF Staff Technologist Seth Schoen arrived at the courthouse with several . As , until recently the president of the (MPAA), arrived, EFF Media Coordinator Annalee Newitz asked Valenti to sign one of the tapes; Valenti complied with her request.
In testimony before the in 1982, Valenti sided with an effort to outlaw early video cassette recorder standard, Betamax. The Valenti testimony included the oft-quoted phrase, "I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone."
The case now before the Supreme Court, MGM v. Grokster, has some similarities to the Betamax case of 1982. Both disputes concern new technologies used for copying media — exclusively video in the earlier Betamax case, all-digital media in the current case of Grokster. There are dissimilarities as well. A recent statement from spokesperson and professional singer, Sheryl Crow, points out that with Betamax technology, "a second copy turned out to be of measurably inferior quality," while with Grokster, "one could possibly distribute millions of perfectly reproduced copies." Crow also quotes an expurgated version of the copyright clause of the US Constitution,

HBO plans expansion of TV channels in Asia

U.S. media giant Time Warner plans to increase the international reach of its HBO television empire with an expansion of television offerings in Asia. The channels will be available via both wired cable services and by satellite, which is more popular in Asia than it is in the United States.
"Cable operators throughout Asia are preparing to dramatically expand channel capacity on many of their systems through digital technology," Jonathan Spink, CEO of HBO Asia said in a "World Screen News" report. He said HBO plans to be one of the first programmers to take advantage of increased channel capacity.
The first new channel HBO plans to launch in Asia is HBO Signature, which is targeted to women. It is planned to debut in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau and Sri Lanka by the end of the year. According to reports, HBO already has struck deals for carriage in all of those countries except Macau.
In addition to programming HBO Signature to women, the company said it plans on two other genre-based channels, but did not disclose what niches they would market toward. A clue could be to look to the U.S. where HBO's niche channels include HBO Family for children-friendly programming and the self-explanatory HBO Comedy channel. Like the parent HBO Asia channel, along with limited original programming, the new genre channels are expected to offer top Hollywood fare dubbed into local languages.
This is the largest expansion of HBO Asia, which has been operating in Asia since 1992 and serves 25 countries, since the launch of Cinemax Asia in 1996.

UK Prime Minister sets 2005 General Election date

The United Kingdom Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Tony Blair PC MP, at 09:00 UTC today formally requested the Queen to dissolve Parliament on April 11, thereby confirming May 5 to be the date for the next General Election.
Mr Blair had delayed the formal request for the dissolution of Parliament for 1 day, as a mark of respect for Pope John Paul II, who died on Saturday April 2. All political parties had suspended campaiging for two days; and Mr Blair and other politicians had been attending services to mourn the death of the Pope. 
Timetable for the dissolution of Parliament.
The wedding of His Royal Highness Prince Charles had previously been scheduled for Friday April 8, and hence Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) would have not sat on that day and would have stopped sitting on Thursday April 7. However, because of that subsequently being the date set for the funeral of Pope John Paul II, the wedding has been postponed to Saturday April 9. 
Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) will thus stop sitting on Friday April 8. This leaves just four days for all remaining legislation to be passed. It is expected that some government bills will be simply dropped, to be reintroduced in the next Parliament if the Labour Party wins the General Election.
The last Prime Minister's Question Time in the House of Commons is scheduled to be tomorrow, Wednesday April 6 at 11:00 UTC.
After the election, the new Parliament is scheduled to be summoned on Wednesday May 11. Its first business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members. The State Opening of Parliament is scheduled to then be on Tuesday May 17.
General Election campaigns start.
The calling of the General Election marks the formal beginning of the general election campaigns by the U.K. political parties, although in practice all three major parties have been actively campaigining for several weeks. The Conservative Party election slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was, for example, used by the party leader Michael Howard in his response to the Budget report on March 16, 2005 and was launched by the Scottish Conservatives on March 10.

13 pilot whales returning to sea, off Western Australia

Rescuers were today sending a pod of 13 pilot whales back into the ocean at Geographe Bay, near to Busselton, south of Perth, in Western Australia. Six additional members of the pod had died during the stranding, including at least one calf. More than 300 people were watching as the whales set out to sea following a 30 hour rescue effort.
The whales had become stranded early yesterday. Several power boats and a spotter plane were escorting the surviving whales towards Cape Naturalist, in an operation expected to take several hours.
Western Australian State Government Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) officers feared that the whales could become stranded again.
One CALM officer, Neil Taylor, told "ABC News" dozens of his colleagues and community volunteers had helped the whales survive throughout the night.
"The vet has checked them all and given them some antibiotics yesterday, last thing before dark," he had told the Australian national broadcaster.
"I think the plan is that the vet will be there again [today] and will give them some vitamins to kick them along before they actually take their swim out to sea."

 The 28th Cooper River Bridge Run and Walk, a yearly event including the third-largest 10k race in the United States, was held Saturday across Charleston's Silas N. Pearman Bridge spanning the Cooper River. 
Linus Maiyo of Kenya, 22, and Olga Romanova of Russia, 24, won the men's and woman's races, respectively. Maiyo finished in 29:30 and Romanova in 34:04. Runners were treated to the "second worst weather" in the history of the race, according to race organizers. It rained for the first hour of the race and the first few minutes of the walk. The morning saw winds of up to 25 miles per hour with temperatures around 65°F.
Before race organizers closed registration early, over 42,000 people signed up for this year's event, vastly more than the record of 30,000 registrants set just last year. Participants represent all fifty states and many countries. The race's popularity has steadily increased since its inception in 1978. 
This may be the last year the race is held on the Pearman Bridge; future races will be held on the new Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge scheduled to open this summer. The Charleston Running Club, which helped start the Cooper River Bridge Run, plans a Burn the Bridges run over the old bridges after traffic moves to the new bridge.
Workers on the Ravenel Bridge cheered the runners and walkers as they passed.

"They can dictate where we can and can't use it," a BHP spokeswoman said.
"The Australian" first reported the decision last week, after Clinton Dines, the chief of BHP's Chinese operations, told analysts about the U.S. Navy's decision. BHP confirmed this story to "The New York Times" in Melbourne last Friday.
The U.S. maintains a list of munitions which are prohibited from being exported to China. Pentagon spokewoman Lt. Col. Tracy O'Grady-Walsh confirmed that the "Falcon" system was on the list of prohibited munitions and that it could not be exported for use in China without a waiver from the President. The ban has been in place since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.
The "Falcon" system, used by BHP under a special license from the U.S. Navy, is based upon American nuclear-submarine technology. Technically described as an "airborne gravity gradiometer", the "Falcon" system has been adapted by BHP to explore for a broad range of minerals underground. BHP has used the system since 2000. At the time, a BHP executive described the system as "the holy grail of the exploration industry."

Desmond Tutu calls for election of African pope

NB this story is also covered in the article Archbishop Desmond Tutu calls for African Pope.
Retired Anglican Arch-Bishop Desmond Tutu has called for the Catholic church to appoint an African as new pope. "We hope the cardinals when they meet will follow the first non-Italian pope by electing the first African pope," said Tutu on SABC TV at a press conference in his Cape Town home.
Nigeria's Cardinal Francis Arinze, currently number four in the church hierarchy, is seen as the best hope for a pope from the third world. If Arinze is elected he will become the first African pope since Gelasius I in 496 AD.
"There should be democracy in the Catholic Church. Europeans should allow an African to become the next pope," said 21 year old Nigerian student, Ifeoma Ezinwa, at the Saint Monica Catholic Church in Igbogbo, Lagos. "The church is growing in Africa. If Arinze gets to that position, he would work for its faster growth," she continued.
However Steve Uwagba, a Nigerian accountant, thought that "International politics in the church may not allow him to get the papal seat. The odds of international politics and conspiracy against Africa weigh heavily against him."
Africa mourns.
Tutu also added that "We know that [the pope] was a champion for world peace. And more than any other pope [he] went around the world galvanizing the faithful who turned out in droves to meet him. We also want to pay tribute to him for his concern for the unity of humankind. He was the first Pope, I think, to gather together ... leaders of other Christian denominations, calling them to prayer for the world,"
The archbishop of Cape Town Njongonkulu Ndungane - Tutu's successor - offered his condolences to the world's catholics. "Our sincerest condolences go out to Catholics worldwide on the death of their great leader. We thank God for his ministry and that he has now been relieved from pain,"
Father Stephen Chukwu of St Augustine's church in Ikorodu on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria said to a congregation of three thousand, "The whole world is standing still. People are held spellbound because the mighty has fallen. The whole church mourns because a leader and a revolutionary has gone," he told the crowd, many of whom wept and sobbed.
"Who would ever believe that a pope could come from outside Rome? He was an ideal man and he led an ideal life. He held tenaciously to the teachings of the Apostles. He was against killing and abortion," he declared. He was not a friend of the wealthy or the mighty. He was a friend of those in the gutters. He preached and fought for democracy.
After mass Mary Okoli, a 42 year old teacher said "My hope and prayer is that we get an African, especially a Nigerian, to replace him and continue his good work,"
"We are particularly grateful for the attention he paid to Africa and the developing world during his papacy. His concern for the poor marked him as a truly caring leader and we share the grief and loss of the Catholic Church at his passing. We also pray for the Catholic Church as it contemplates the election of the next Vicar of Christ," he said in a statement.

Voyager space probes face shutdown

Interplanetary space probes Voyager 1 and 2, after traveling 28 years
and 14 billion kilometers to the edge of the solar system and the
threshold of interstellar space, face a possible shutdown in October
of this year.
NASA's Earth-Sun System division, which runs the program, amongst
others, has had to cut its budget for next year from 74 million to 53
million dollars, calling for some project abandonments. The cuts for
Voyager and other missions are planned to help fund President George
W. Bush's "Vision for Space Exploration", his plan to return to the moon
and a manned mission to Mars.
According to the Washington Post, Dick Fisher, NASA's deputy director
for the Earth-Sun division, said the agency based its cuts on a
"senior review" by outside experts, giving Voyager a low priority
among the division's 13 "extended" missions.
It costs NASA $4.2 million a year to run the Voyager science
programs which have an expected operating lifetime to the year 2020.
Both spacecraft function well and continue to return valuable
scientific data. Most recently, information about massive solar
flares that occurred in 2003 and the resulting shock waves that
traveled through the solar system were detected by Voyager 2 in April
of 2004.
"There are no other plans to reach the edge of the solar system," said
Stamatios Krimigis, on board the Voyager mission since before the
launch in 1977. "Now we're getting all this new information, and here
comes NASA saying, 'We want to pull the plug.' "
Other missions possibly affected by the budget cuts include: Ulysses,
to study the sun; Geotail, Wind, and Polar studying effects of solar
events on Earth; Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST), studying Earth's aurora
and the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), studying solar
atmosphere and magnetic fields.
No final decisions have been made as of yet but are expected to come
sometime this month, possibly by April 15. Edward Stone of the
California Institute of Technology told Nature magazine: "We are
currently developing a plan for shutdown."

Talks held to avert Nigerian oil production strike

April 4, 2005
Talks are being held between Nigerian unions and the country's government ahead of possible strikes next week. Earlier talks last week ended with no agreement.
The unions have called for three-day warning strikes over issues of job cuts and welfare. Although common, such short strikes tend to have little effect on oil producers as they can often manage to maintain production for short periods with non-union staff.
However there exists the possibility of supply interruptions from the world's eighth largest producer of oil if the union's fears are not dealt with and more strikes take place.
"Today's meeting is crucial," said the deputy of the Pengassan union Babatunde Ogun. "We will focus on Conoil and Belpop. If these issues can be resolved today, then things will be much easier," he continued, referring to the two state-owned companies at the centre of the dispute.
While in London on late Sunday the Nigerian Presidential Petroleum Advisor Edmund Daukoru said he was hopeful the state and the unions could reach a deal.

Royal wedding delayed as Prince plans for Pope's funeral

The wedding of Britain’s Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles was postponed by one day to allow Prince Charles to represent the Royals at Friday's funeral of Pope John Paul II. The Royal's wedding will now be celebrated on Saturday, April 9.
The Prince cut short his Swiss skiing holiday and returned to London today. He will make travel arrangements for his trip to The Vatican on Friday, and attend a memorial service for the pope at London’s Westminster Cathedral this afternoon. Mrs. Parker Bowles will accompany him today, according to his Clarence House office.
Parker Bowles will not be joining Prince Charles for the Pope's funeral. However, Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, will be in attendance.
The change in wedding plans threw Windsor businesses in disarray, where hotels had taken bookings for Friday wedding parties. The owner of a crafts center there, Kashmir Dhillon, had to order fresh tea towels with the April 9 date. “We will be the only ones with the 9th on it if it goes ahead,” she said.
A series of postponements have hampered the Prince's and Parker Bowles' wedding arrangements. Initially they were planning to use Windsor Castle, but were unable since it was not licensed for civil ceremonies. After it moved to a more meager town hall setting, the Queen decided not to attend, immediately generating rumors of a royal snub.
The Queen will still attend the blessing ceremony at Windsor Castle afterwards.
There also was debate over what name Parker Bowles would take should her husband become King. Prince Charles liked “princess consort,” but the government says she must be called “queen,” whether she uses the title or not.
Final arrangements for the wedding will be announced soon, according to the prince's spokesperson.
Prince Charles divorced his first wife, Princess Diana in 1996, a year before she died in an automobile accident in Paris.

Legendary Canadian football coach Frank Clair has died

, the (CFL) coach and architect of the powerhouse of the 1960s and 70s died Sunday at the age of 87 in , , .
Nicknamed "The Professor" for his skills at recognising talent, teaching the game, and ability to get the most from players, Clair first came to Canada to coach the in 1950 and ended his first CFL year with a championship; repeating with the Argos in 1952. He left the Argonauts following a salary dispute and ended up in Ottawa in 1956 where he took on the daunting task of reviving the Rough Riders team which were poorly run and disorganised. He led the team to an incredible 14 consecutive seasons of playoff appearances and three Grey Cups.
He retired from coaching following the 1969 Grey Cup to take over the position. At that time, Clair led the CFL in seasons coached (19), regular-season victories (147), playoff seasons (17), consecutive playoff seasons (14), playoff victories (22), Grey Cup appearances (six) and Grey Cup victories (five). His winning ways continued as GM when Ottawa won the 1973 and 1976 Grey Cups. Nevertheless, he was let go in 1978 and Ottawa has not won a Grey Cup since.
According to the "Ottawa Sun", former sports editor Jane O'Hara described Clair as a no-nonsense, to-the-point, type of gentleman who was short on smiles, but always seen coaching his team wearing a snap-brim fedora and standing poker-faced and erect on the sidelines.
He was inducted into the in 1981 as a builder and the Ottawa stadium () was renamed in his honour in 1993.

 lawyer informed the media that Terri Schiavo's body was cremated last Saturday at 9 a.m. on April 2nd at the National Cremation Society in Florida.
A complete was done prior to the cremation to dispel any beliefs that the cremation was done to hide anything about Schiavo's condition. According to the district medical examiner's office in Largo, full results of the autopsy will not be ready for several weeks.
Terri Schiavo's parents, the Schindlers, requested an independent expert to observe the operation, but the request was denied by medical examiners.
Both sides of Terri Schiavo's family plan to have separate funerals. Mr. Schiavo apparently plans to bury Terri's remains in Pennsylvania, while the Schindlers are planning a funeral mass tomorrow at the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in , Florida.

China censors, arrests Catholics in wake of Pope's death

Chinese Catholics' response to the recent death of pontiff John Paul II have motivated more actions against free speech and arrests in China by the government, AsiaNews reports. 
At the same time as the Chinese government is expressing condolences for the death of John Paul II, it has begun the arrest of dozens of Catholics, particularly among the underground church. The Vatican has already protested the arrest of Catholic leaders. Some of the most recent arrests include auxiliary bishop Yao Liang on 31 March and Father Wang Jinling on 1 April, both from Hebei province dioceses.
Many other Catholic leaders have been arrested without having charges brought against them.
Various websites have apparently been censored by the government. Likewise, many online forums and chat groups discussing the figure and life of John Paul II have appeared, yet, on 2 April, almost all news about the pope disappeared, stated AsiaNews.
One Chinese priest is reported as declaring, "the pope knew communism, and has always helped and encouraged us to live the faith and to be courageous in the face of persecution," AsiaNews quoted.
Alongside the Catholic Patriotic Organization, the government-approved church's official name, underground churches throughout China have been holding religious services.

Nigerian Housing Minister fired in anti-corruption drive

Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has dismissed the Minister of Housing, Alice Mobolaji Osomo, as part of an on-going anti-corruption drive to clean up Nigeria's world image.
A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a "BBC" report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.
President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million naira (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry.

Al Gore-owned cable news channel to relaunch August 1 with viewer-created content

 A year after buying the struggling Newsworld International 24-hour U.S. and Canada cable news channel, former U.S. vice president Al Gore and his partner, millionaire Ohio attorney and politician Joel Hyatt, plan to re-launch the channel with a new name, a new concept and a new target audience.
Starting August 1, the channel will be known as Current and will aim its news programming at the 18-34 year old demographic that traditionally does not tune into cable news. "The Internet opened a floodgate for young people whose passions are finally being heard, but TV hasn't followed suit. Young adults have a powerful voice, but you can't hear that voice on television ... yet," Gore said in a press release issued from the network's San Francisco studios.
Gore said the new channel will be partly created by citizen journalists, where viewer-created reports will find their way on air. "We want to transform the television medium itself, giving a national platform to those who are hungry to help create the TV they want to watch. We're creating a powerful new brand of television that doesn't treat audiences as merely viewers, but as collaborators," Gore said in the release. The network posted submission guidelines on its new website which launched Monday.
Gore bought Newsworld International (NWI) from Vivendi Universal last year for $70 million. It was the only TV asset of Vivendi's not snapped up by NBC in the creation of the NBC Universal media conglomerate. NBC already had two struggling cable news channels of its own. NWI's current news content is mostly rebroadcasts of news produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Originally, the network was going to be remodled as a liberal counterpart to the popular Fox News Channel, which some critics claim is a conservative-slanted newscast despite the network's denial that it is "fair and balanced" in its reporting. But after market research, the new owners of NWI decided that a liberal news network was not financially feasible.
Instead, they focused on a youth-skewed news channel under the code name "INdTV" (pronounced "Indy Tee Vee"). The new name, Current, and re-launch date announcement was timed to coincide with the annual National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association convention, which is being held this week in San Francisco, the same city as Channel's new headquarters.

Abu Ghraib prison camp struck by tractor bomb

April 5, 2005 
A suicide tractor bombing struck the American held Abu Ghraib prison camp Monday, the 2nd attack in two days. Four Iraqi civilians are reported wounded.
The explosion occurred near the gates to the prison camp, and comes on the heels of a large attack earlier on Saturday, where both US soldiers and Iraqi detainees were injured. The apparent motive of the Saturday attack was to free detainees.
The "New York Times" reports that an official of the Interior Ministry said a letter was written by a woman who claims to be a detainee at the prison. In the letter, she reportedly begs to have the prison attacked to save her from the dishonor of rape by her American captors. The letter was circulated among Sunni mosques.
An internet posting by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claims responsibility for both the Abu Ghraib attacks. The Al Qaeda militant group also claimed responsibility for the first attack.
The report of the tractor bombing came as military officials were announcing that a short riot broke out Friday in another American prison called Camp Bucca. Rocks were thrown and tents set on fire during a protest over several prisoners who were being transferred. Four guards and twelve prisoners were injured.
The Camp Bucca facility holds about 6,000 detainees, while Abu Ghraib holds 3,300.

Triple limb-reattachment fails - boy loses foot

Terry Vo, the 10-year old Australian boy who had two hands and a foot reattached by surgeons after losing them in an accident, has had to have the foot re-amputated. He will be given a prosthetic foot in its place.
The operation to re-attach three limbs was thought to have been a first - but was ultimately unsuccessful, with the foot having died inside, and receiving insufficient blood supply following the surgery to reattach it.
"That would lead to the small muscles in the foot actually constricting, the toes bending over and a deformed ... foot that is sort of clawed over and doesn't have good sensation," said plastic surgeon, Mr Robert Love today, on Australia's ABC Radio.
"Even if you can get all of that to survive, he [would be] worse off than having had an amputation."
"What is very disappointing is that for the first two days after [the operation] the foot looked absolutely magnificent," he said.
Terry's hands were healing well, said the surgeon. The prosthetic foot would allow him to walk normally, since his knee was intact.

'Great' title for John Paul?

If recent trends are to portend the future, late Roman Catholic pontiff John Paul II may be known to posterity as "John Paul the Great."
A growing portion of Catholics, and even senior clergy, have begun to use the title, which has been held previously by only three out of history's 264 popes.
Pope Gregory I of the sixth century, of the fifth century, and of the ninth century up to now, have alone been acclaimed "Great" in church tradition.
 of New York, Cardinal O'Brien of Edinburgh (Scotland), Dublin's Archbishop Martin, and of Westminster — the highest Catholic clergyman in England and Wales — have been among those reported to have used the honorific for John Paul II.
Historian Robert Louis Wilken, writing in Catholic periodical "Commonweal" in 2003, "Greatness is as mysterious as it is elusive," alluding to the ambiguity of the criteria used in applying the title. 
For instance, some figures — such as theologian or the apostle , the first pope — despite their wide influence in church history, have not been granted the honorific by historians or Catholic tradition, while others relatively unknown today were indeed accorded it. 
Newspapers in Italy, the United States, and throughout the globe have featured the acclamation "Great" for the deceased pontiff. Catholic-oriented websites and online forums, as well, abound with the title.
The 's official paper, "L’Osservatore Romano", also echoed the "Great" appellation. 
Moreover, a Vatican homily text for Sunday, 3 April, contained a reference to the title. Though the honorific was ultimately not used during the homily's delivery by Cardinal , until John Paul II's death, it is maintained that Vatican documents can be considered official even when not read aloud.

Owner of Wendy's chili finger still not found

Health officials in San Jose, California are still unable to identify the owner of the missing finger found in a bowl of chili at a local Wendy's restaurant last week. 
Fingerprints on the detached digit have been run through an FBI database as well as the local criminal database in Santa Clara County, but no matches were found. According to Rich Reneau, who is currently leading the investigation, the fingerprint was marginal, and the likelihood of finding a match is slim.
The finger is also undergoing DNA tests by the county medical examiner, which could determine the race and gender of the owner of said finger.
Plans for a toxicology lab to run tests on the finger to see if the tissue contains preservative chemicals, such as embalming compounds are underway.
According to Lt. Chris Forrester, the coroner may end up hiring a private lab to run further tests on the finger.
Wendy's International stock was trading at US$39.37 Tuesday morning, relatively unchanged from its levels last week, before the news hit the stock markets.

As Chinese premier Wen Jiabao continues his tour across South Asia, visiting first India and now Pakistan, it has been announced that Pakistan will purchase frigate warships from China. 
China has also previously declared its hope of cooperation with India's government.
A frigate is a warship typically used to protect other naval vessels or merchant marine ships and to combat enemy submarines.
Pakistan and India have traditionally been considered rivals. Both nations, however, have garnerned favor and support from the US in recent times. 
Pakistan has granted much support to the American campaign against terrorists in Central Asia. The United States has recently announced its intention to help India, a past rival of China, become a "superpower." India has also been planning military expansion/modernization. The United States has also declared its willingness to supply F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan as well.

Irish betting shop chain, Paddy Power, is taking bets for a new Pope. The current front runners are Cardinal Francis Arinze of Nigeria and Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi of Italy, who have each been given odds of 11-4.
"Our feeling is, we held off a few days, and now the cardinals themselves are convening in Rome," Darren Haines, a spokesman for Paddy Power said.
"We do it very much in the same way as a horse race," Haines added, "Without sounding so callous, in a sense, we have contenders, and you very much rate the speculation on the contenders, very much by going on media reports in the religious press ...

China responds to US plan for import quotas

 is questioning a decision by the U.S. Commerce Department that seeks to re-impose trade quotas on Chinese textiles. The three-decade long system of quotas was lifted on January 1.
"This is not reasonable," Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters. "This is unfair. This is protectionist."
The U.S. administration justified their decision by presenting data which showed increases of over one thousand percent for cotton knit shirts and cotton trousers. The administration also cited a 300 percent increase of imports of underwear.
Qin disputed the U.S. reasoning for the decision.
"The major reason for this issue is that the United States has over-protectionist, irrational and unreasonable arrangements," he said.
"Other countries that are more competitive will still take over from China, and the US can't impose safeguards on those countries," Peter Liu, chairman of the textiles and apparel committee at the American Chamber of Commerce, told the "Financial Times" in Hong Kong. "Obviously, the US textile industry has concerns about job elimination, but on the other hand there are a lot of US industries that like to do business with China by exporting to China. If this escalates into a trade war, that's to nobody's benefit," he said.
The U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel (AITA) also supports China's product imports.
"There is no reason to believe that imports of these products from China are causing market disruption," AITA spokeswoman Laura E. Jones said.
The U.S. administration cited a need to avoid "market disruption."
"Free trade must be fair trade, and we will work to ensure that American manufacturers and workers compete on a level playing field," read a statement issued by U.S. Commerce department spokeman Carlos M. Gutierrez. "The decision is the first step in a process to determine whether the U.S. market for these products is being disrupted and whether China is playing a role in that disruption." The statement also said the administration was "providing assistance to our domestic textile and apparel industry consistent with our international rights and obligations."
"We are very pleased that the government is taking this action," Lloyd Wood, a spokesman for the American Manufacturing Trade Coalition told "The New York Times". "It sends a strong message to China that predatory trade practices will be investigated."
The U.S. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements issued its decision on Monday, under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). China joined the WTO in 2001.
Shirts, trousers, and underwear are one of the few remaining types of clothing manufactured in the United States. The United States is running an all-time high trade deficit with China of US$162 billion.

Talk-therapy can make a difference in early treatment of severe depression

An individual in the initial stages of moderate to severe depression may experience relief from cognitive therapy equivalent to careful drug therapy. This is the conclusion from the April issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, a publication of The Journal of the American Medical Association’s “Archives.”
Although antidepressant medications are the most widely used and effective treatment, cognitive, or talk-therapy, under the direction of highly trained professionals, has now shown potential in treating the early stages of major depressive disorder.
An eight week study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University examined the response of 240 depressed patients, randomly placed into three groups. The first group (n=120) received psychological therapy; the second (n=60) a more traditional drug routine, and the third group (n=60) only pills.
The study found that both treated groups recovered wellness much better than the placebo group. At eight weeks, the medication group was at 50 per cent, the cognitive therapy group was at 43 per cent while the pill placebo group had only a 25 per cent improvement.
After 16 weeks both medically treated groups had about 58 per cent improvement. Remission rates were better with the antidepressant medications at 46 percent with 40 per cent for the cognitive therapy group. Further follow up showed sustained improvement with the medicine-treated group in the Vanderbilt University location. The U of P groups remained about equal.
In conclusion, the report stated, “Cognitive therapy can be as effective as medications for the initial treatment of moderate to severe major depression, but this degree of effectiveness may depend on a high level of therapist experience or expertise.”

2005 National Conference in the Norwegian Centre Party

NORWAY; Kristiansand: In the weekend between the 11. and 13. of March the Norwegian Centre Party held its annual National Conference in Kristiansand. The conference was clearly inspired by the prospects of a majority in the parliament together with the Norwegian Socialist Left- and Labour Party, according to all polls.
In this conference the leader, Åslaug Haga, was re-elected against one vote and to great applaus from the 187 other voters. 
Compromise on oil drilling in the Barents Sea &lt;br&gt;
The matter of greatest anticipation before the convention was a question if the environmentalist Centre Party would open for oil drilling in the Barents Sea. The Centre Youth had clearly announced its opposition to the suggestion at an earlier point. 
After a long debate with both very young and very old committed debaters the coalition of the hardest environmentalists, the leader and the Centre Youth surprisingly lost the voting. The Centre Party opened for a compromise proposed by one of the two second leaders, Lars Peder Brekk, on accepting oil drilling with untraditionally strong demands for environmental safety.
Focus on decentralization &lt;br&gt;
The leader, Åslaug Haga, and most of the debaters in the conference made it clear that the Centre Party was sharpening it decentralization-knives. In the conference Haga was joined by several other active members in underlining the Centre Partys role as the most dedicated decentralizationing-party in Norway.
It was clear from the debaters that the main role of the party in a possibly upcoming majority-government (majority in parliament) with the Labour and Socialist Left Party mainly was to make the government focus on turning around the sentralization of Norway and to hinder the Labour Party and the Conservative Party from cooperating on sending a new application for membership in the European Union.

2005 National Conference in the Norwegian Socialist Left Party

NORWAY, Kristiansand: This weekend (1. - 3. April) the Norwegian Socialist Left Party held its 16. ordinary National Conference. The conference was characterized by the members and speakers obvious belief in themselves winning the upcoming election together with the Norwegian Labour Party and the Norwegian Centre Party. This partly unofficial alliance has lately been leading all polls with the rarity of a majority of the members of parliament ("Stortinget"). Norway has not seen a government with a majority in the parliament since shortly after WWII, when the Labour Party governed.
New gas powerplants in Norway &lt;br&gt;
In a resolution from the conference the Socialist Left Party opens for the building of new gas powerplants in Norway, as long as these powerplants do not release any CO2 into the atmosphere. 
This has been a matter of great discussion in Norway and prime ministers have given away their chairs in the dispute. In the latter the Centre Party also made a similar resolution, and so it seems the upcoming government will open for the building of these plants.
Agains membership in the European Union&lt;br&gt;
The Socialist Left Party is still clearly opposed to Norway entering the European Union (with only five votes for membership). 
As both Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party are clear non-unionist parties, it seems they will block the Labour Party from sending any applications for membership in the upcoming four-year government period. 
More abortion and status quo on prostitution&lt;br&gt;
The Socialist Left Party wants to expand the time limit for abortion to 16 weeks after impregnation.
The Socialist Left Party does "not" want to criminalize the act of buying services from prostitutes. 
There was a great deal of discussion surrounding the subject of prostitution. As the Socialist Left Party has a large group of feminists among its active members, there was a great minority voting "for" criminalization.

April 6, 2005 
The Detroit Tigers began their 2005 season in style on April 4, defeating the Kansas City Royals 11-2 in their home opener of the Major League Baseball season. The game, played in front of a record crowd of 44,105 at Detroit's Comerica Park, was an offensive showcase for the Tigers, led by Dmitri Young, who went 4-for-4, matching a career-high 5 RBIs. Three of Young's four hits were home runs, making Young only the third baseball player in history to hit three home runs in a season opener. The previous two players to accomplish that feat are George Bell, who hit three home runs for the Toronto Blue Jays against the Royals on opening day, 1988; and Tuffy Rhodes, who hit three home runs for the Chicago Cubs against the New York Mets in 1994.
Tigers starter Jeremy Bonderman was the winning pitcher, the youngest starter to win an opening day game since 1986.

Miles-long queue to view Pope John Paul one last time

Tens of thousands of regular people walked through the domed St. Peter's Basilica today, but the queue behind them never seemed to ebb, according to reporters in The Vatican.
Winding over two miles from the bier holding the Pontiff's body all the way to the Tiber River, backpackers from all over the world, young and old, students and the disabled, waited and slowly shuffled toward their goal: one last look at the pope they had come to feel was like a father to them.
A French park ranger spoke of the physical pain the pope must have suffered while remaining so peaceful in spirit. Another visitor was hoping to kiss his hand or touch his robe. They were satisfied with merely a chance to view his crimson-robed body, as visible in death as he had been only weeks earlier, in life.
Nearly 2 million people will visit The Vatican for the funeral service on Friday, an unprecedented salute for a public figure who may have helped bring down the Iron Curtain.
Other voices were heard as well, but they were in dissent. Amidst Pope Paul’s uncompromising orthodoxy, they said, he had destroyed democracy in the Church and alienated many. And although most of the mourners were contrite and moved slowly through the long queue, there were the usual “line jumpers,” greeted by catcalls and impatient reactions from others.
“Filthy pigs! We’ll all be dead by the time we get in,” an elderly woman spat in Italian.
The city of Rome, which surrounds Vatican City, has set up campgrounds in stadiums and public places for open use during the events. One lady said she didn’t care where she slept or even if she would.
Sabina La Versa had taken the all-night train from Sicily to view the pontiff. She said “The pope’s love for us flowed like water from a jug. I’d wait here forever to say arrivederci,” Italian for “see you again.”

The Baseball officials and the players' union have both decided to not disclose the specific substance which tested positive.
Sanchez originally planed an appeal against the ban, but decided against it. He denies taking any performance enhancing drugs and blames the positive test on over-the-counter vitamins, muscle relaxants and protein shakes that he takes, but has not identified any specific medications as of yet.

Bomb explodes on historic Kashmir bus route

April 6, 2005 
A bomb, injuring three people, exploded on a new bus service route 
between the Indian and Pakistani sides of the Kashmir border. Two other bombs on the route were found and defused. A replacement bus is scheduled for an inaugural run this Thursday.
Threats of violence against passengers, and attacks on the bus on the
inaugural trip, were issued by Muslim militants.
The bombs were found on a section of highway between Srinigar, in Indian-controlled
Kashmir, and Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. The defused explosives weighed more than 60 kilograms each.
No civilians have traveled this route since 1947, when
India and Pakistan won independence from
Britain. The Kashmir territory has been under dispute by India and
Pakistan since that time, with China joining the dispute in 1962 when
it took control of a region along the eastern border.
The bus link is seen as a major step toward healing the hostilities
between India and Pakistan by allowing families, separated for decades
during the dispute, to re-unite.
Since 1989, a handful of Islamic militant groups have fought for
Kashmir to become independent or to merge with predominantly Muslim
Pakistan. With the bus route opening coming on the top of
other so-called "confidence-building" moves between Pakistan and
India, the militants apparently feel their movement is under threat.
Bharat Karnad, an analyst with New Delhi think-tank Center for Policy
Research, stated: "Once people get their free access and they can
freely move from one territory to another, meet the families and so
on, the great incentive and motivation is gone to risk their lives to
fight for some notion of jihad that some groups may propound."
Most of the 24 passengers expected to take the maiden voyage,
officials say, are in protective custody because of threats made by
some of the militant groups against them and their families.

Harvard University divests $4.4m of PetroChina stock

April 6, 2005
In response to pressure from students and faculty, Harvard University announced on April 4 that it would sell its shares of PetroChina stock, the Harvard Crimson reported. The Crimson noted that the University held 67,200 shares of PetroChina in December of 2004. At present prices, the stock would be worth approximately $4.4 million, said the paper. The precise details of Harvard's holdings in PetroChina were not specified in the University's statement; it stated simply that it would direct the Harvard Management Company to "divest its holdings of PetroChina stock."
PetroChina is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company, which invested $1bn in what the Crimson called a "joint venture" with the government of Sudan to develop the nation's oil infrastructure. The company was characterized as playing a "leading role . . . in the Sudanese oil industry, which is so important to the Sudanese regime" by Harvard president Lawrence Summers, said the Globe.
According to the Boston Globe, Harvard's divestment is particularly significant because Harvard "never fully divested itself from companies doing business with apartheid South Africa, unlike many other major universities."
The divestment occurred after a petition started by two Harvard juniors, Ben Collins and Manav Bhatnagar, circulated at the University, receiving signatures from more than 80 faculty members and hundreds of students.

NASA's Mars rovers exceed all expectations

April 6, 2005 
With the approval of an additional 18 months of funding, NASA's twin Mars rovers, the Spirit and Opportunity, will continue their exploration of "fantastic" landscapes for an additional 14 months.
"The rovers have proven their value with major discoveries about ancient watery environments on Mars that might have harbored life," said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. "We are extending their mission through September 2006 to take advantage of having such capable resources still healthy and in excellent position to continue their adventures."
With 11 months of extensions exceeding their successful three-month prime missions, "We now have to make long-term plans for the vehicles because they may be around for quite a while," said Jim Erickson, rover project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 
Scientists are within a few football field’s distance of a region called “Etched Terrain,” with rocks exposed by actual wind erosion rather than craters. There are rocks different from others in any other time in Mars’ history. "This is a journey into the unknown, to something completely new," said Dr. Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., and principal investigator for the rover's science instruments.
The rover Opportunity has overtaken Spirit in total distance driven. It has been pushed by rover planners to roll more than three miles—eight times the original goal.
On March 20, a new Martian record of 722 feet in a single 24-hour drive was accomplished by Opportunity. Even Spirit is exceeding expectations although it is in much rougher terrain, climbing a rocky slope toward an area called “Husband Hill.”
The rovers have shown signs of wear and tear. Spirit’s rock abrasion tool grinding teeth might be nearly useless after exposing the interior of five times more rocks than its original design goal of only three rocks.

51 suspects named by UN for war crimes in Darfur

April 6, 2005 
The Sudanese Government said it will not hand over 51 suspects named by the UN for war crimes in the Darfur region.
The sealed list, presented to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday, was drawn up following an investigation by the UN into claims of killings, torture and rape committed by Government forces and militias in the Darfur region. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, backed by huge protests against the UN in Sudan's capital of Khartoum, snubbed the UN resolution which was passed last week to bring suspects to trial before the court. Omar al-Bashir explained that he "shall never hand any Sudanese national to a foreign court". 
ICC's chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said, "Now, we have a common task to end the culture of impunity," upon receiving the list of suspects at the UN headquarters in New York. He continued: "I will closely monitor ongoing crimes in Darfur as well as efforts to prevent and stop them". The Darfur case is expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICC, whose purpose is to try alleged genocide, war crimes and mass human rights violations criminals.
As the ICC, based in the Hague, received thousands of pages of evidence collected by UN investigators, Sudanese protesters descended upon the gates of the UN compound in Khartoum, fiercely criticising the UN's involvement in the Darfur conflict. 
"We are coming here to say to America 'no' to these orders. We are not people who have to listen to orders from anybody except the Sudan," one demonstrator told the BBC. Stating that it will prosecute suspects itself, Sudan's government earlier described the UN's decision to try individuals allegedly linked to the atrocities committed in Darfur as "unfair, ill-advised and narrow-minded". The UN has since said it hoped the Sudanese Government would cooperate before indictments and arrest warrants are issued, and the UN understood that Sudanese rebels will surrender to the court if they are indicted. 
According to the UN, at least 180,000 people have died and more than two million have fled the region since the conflict between black African rebels and Arab militia began two years ago.

Brazil organizes Summit of South American and Arab Countries

Brazil's capital city of Brasilia is scheduled to host the Summit of South American and Arab Countries from May 10 to the 11th, according to the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations. The organizers say that South American and Arab Countries will discuss political, commercial, cultural, and scientific and technological cooperation.
The summit was proposed by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva during his visit to several Arab countries in December, 2004. This was the first time some of the countries visited by Lula had entered into contact with a Brazilian ruler since 1876 with then Brazilian Emperor, Dom Pedro II.
During a visit to the headquarters of the Arab League, in Cairo, Egypt, Lula da Silva proposed the creation of a Summit of South American and Arab Countries. "The summit aims the creation of a new world where the Third World countries can have a new role", Lula added.
The countries scheduled to meet next month are:
Some concerns from Israel and the United States have been raised since the announcement of the meeting. However the Brazilian Minister of Foreign Relations, Celso Amorim, said that the meeting is intended as a forum to discuss only cooperation between the two regions and it is not a political attack on Israel. "It is a meeting of two regions, which will discuss mutual cooperation", he says.

British journalists on trial in Zimbabwe

Correspondent Toby Harnden and photographer Julian Simmonds of "The Sunday Telegraph" weekly, were put on trial for violating Zimbabwe's "Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act". The act requires all journalists in Zimbabwe to obtain accreditation from the state media commission. The two are also accused of breaking immigration laws by overstaying their visas.
The journalists were arrested last Thursday during the election that saw victory for President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF. The trial is being held in a small town 40 kilometers north of Harare, capital of Zimbabwe. Despite being granted bail, the pair are spending a fifth night behind bars in Harare. Although they face two years in jail, it is believed they will instead be fined and deported.
"The accused persons had no right to cover the elections because they had no accreditation and had no right to stay in the country beyond March 28," State prosecutor Albert Masama said in court statements.
The prosecutor said the two flew into Harare and met unnamed members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Simmonds was arrested after he was seen taking photographs of a line of voters at a polling station.
Defence lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, said the men had valid visas and believed they were in Zimbabwe legally when they were arrested. She said the two were tourists and visited such resorts as the Victoria Falls.
More than 200 journalists were accredited to cover last week's elections, but many more had their applications rejected.

Jeter saves the day for the Yankees

After a blowout win for the New York Yankees on Sunday, their ancient rivalry with the 2004 World Series champion Boston Red Sox resumed with a close game on Tuesday that went down to the wire. Yankees closer Mariano Rivera had a blown save in the top of the ninth when he surrendered a solo home run to Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek that tied the score at 3-3. Yankee Derek Jeter saved the day in his lead-off at bat in the bottom of the ninth, hitting a walk-off home run off Keith Foulke to win the game for the Yankees. Yankees manager Joe Torre said, "We escaped today. Mariano is still the best in the game as far as I'm concerned. That doesn't mean that clubs aren't going to get to him once in a while. These guys we're playing are the world champs."
Rivera and the Yankees won't soon forget the glory snatched from them by the Red Sox in last year's American League Championship Series. The Red Sox were within three outs of being defeated in a sweep when they rallied against Mariano Rivera at Fenway Park in Game 4. They went on to win in 12 innings, and won the next three games to take the Series, and went on to win the World Series.
Other spotlights included starting pitcher Carl Pavano's debut for the Yankees and Hideki Matsui, who hit his second home run in two games.
Today's game was played in front of 54,690 at Yankee Stadium.

First female boxing death occurs in US sanctioned match

Becky Zerlentes, 34, died on Sunday, April 3 in what was to be her last boxing match before retirement. The match, a Colorado State Golden Gloves bout, was held in Denver on April 2. Her opponent for the senior women's title in that match was Heather Schmitz, 32.
Zerlentes received a knockout punch in the third round by a straight blow to her left temple. She received immediate attention from ringside physicians, but never regained consciousness, even after being admitted to Denver General Hospital for emergency surgery on Saturday night. She expired on Sunday due to blunt-force trauma injuries received to the head, resulting in a blood clot on the brain.
Her opponent Heather Schmitz met with reporters and expressed her regret, saying, "I didn't want to hurt her. I feel very bad about that."
"Nobody thought it was a very hard blow," said Jeanne DePriest, manager of Zerlentes' team. "We've been talking to people all day trying to find out what happened." Zerlentes was wearing her required protective headgear at the time of the accident.
Several commentators have remarked on the coincidental similarities between Zerlentes' death and the events depicted in the recent Oscar-winning film, Million Dollar Baby, in which a character becomes quadriplegic as a result of a spinal cord injury suffered during her last fight.
USA Boxing oversees the sport of amateur, Olympic-style boxing in America, as a member organization of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA). The non-profit organization has overseen men's amateur boxing since 1888, but has only admitted women to the sport since 1993. There are currently 2,200 registered women boxers, according to USA Boxing, and interest in the sport is increasing.
"The USA Boxing family's thoughts and prayers go out to Becky's family and husband. We are deeply saddened by this loss," said Sandy Martinez-Pino, president of USA Boxing.
In the aftermath of Zerlentes' tragic death, the USA Boxing authorities have continued to affirm their high level of safety precautions and close oversight of the sport's conditions and equipment. According to their website, amateur boxing was ranked 23rd in rate of injuries, behind soccer and gymnastics (National Safety Council, 1996) and 8th in rate of sports-related fatalities, behind football and scuba diving (Boxing and Medicine, Human Kinetics Illinois, 1995).
Zerlentes had an amateur record of 6-4 (6 wins to 4 losses), and was a former regional boxing champion with several brown belts in martial arts. She had a PhD in Geography from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and was an Adjunct Instructor in geography at Front Range Community College in Colorado. She is survived by a husband and family.

North American citizens dealt passport requirement

North American travelers will see a phased-in requirement to carry passports in the coming years. In a multi-national initiative to restrict illegal immigration and travel, a passport layer of stricter identification will be introduced for travel throughout the continent by the year 2008. The US State Department announced the new American travel rules Monday. 
For the most part, North American citizens can now travel to neighboring countries without formal papers. But starting in December 2005, U.S. citizens travelling by air or sea to or from the Caribbean, Central and South America will need a passport to get back into their native nation. Showing a driver's license or a government-issued photo ID card will no longer be sufficient for making the border crossing back.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that passport restrictions will help keep out "people who want to hurt us." 
Rice made a brief trip on March 10 to meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox before leaving on her Far East tour. The Mexican meeting was to pave the way for a March 23 summit with Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and Fox at the President Bush ranch in Texas. Issues concerning immigration, border security and water rights were discussed at the meeting. The intent of the summit was to produce a North American initiative that will strengthen security and economic ties.
The passport rules are a result of that summit.
The next phase of the passport requirements begins Dec 2006, when passports for air and sea travel to, or from Mexico and Canada, the Caribbean, Bermuda and US will be required. The final phase involves any travel: whether air, sea or land crossings, passports will be required at borders by Dec 7, 2008.

Businesses shy to adopt Windows XP SP2

A survey of 251 North American companies revealed that less than 10% of their computers have Windows XP Service Pack 2 installed. The results of the study, conducted by AssetMetrix, were released this week after 136,000 PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system were examined. Although many of the companies in the poll are still using earlier releases of Windows, such as Windows 2000 and Windows 98, only 24% of businesses using Windows XP had successfully rolled out SP2.
Released in September 2004, SP2 includes security improvements for the Windows XP operating system, including an enhanced firewall and a pop-up ad blocker for Internet Explorer. When it was first made available, businesses could opt to postpone installation of the service pack so that their respective IT departments could prepare for the update. However on April 12, Microsoft will force users to upgrade to SP2 via their automatic Windows Update system, which delivers software over the Internet. AssetMetrix believe this move will catch out unprepared companies.
"Microsoft allowed a significant period of time to accommodate companies' demand to test and validate Windows XP SP2 within their IT infrastructure," explained AssetMetrix Research Labs' managing director Steve O'Halloran.
He added: "Based on our research, a substantial number of companies have yet to decide whether to accept or embargo Windows XP SP2. To date, we have observed that 40 percent of companies using Windows XP have actively avoided upgrading to SP2, and only 7 percent have actively accepted it. The other 52 percent of the companies showed no direction or policy towards SP2, and may find themselves having support issues by allowing multiple editions of Windows XP to exist in their infrastructure."

Taiwan’s Blue Camp pays respects on the thirtieth anniversary of the passing of Chiang Kai-shek

Translated from report by: Zhang Yongtai (Voice of America/ Taipei)
"In order to remember the passing away of Taiwan's former leader, the opposition parties of the Pan Blue Camp used the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday to visit Chiang’s tomb and pay respects. However the Democratic Progressive Party government did not hold any similar activities."
The chairs of Taiwan’s opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT), New Party (NP) and People First Party (PFP) used the Tomb Sweeping Day break to lead trips to the Taoyuan county Tzuhu and Touliao mausoleums (resting spots of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo respectably.) Because the bodies of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo are planned to be moved to Wutzushan military cemetery in Taipei County in August of this year, the opportunity to visit the tombs of the two former leaders is almost gone.
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pays no visits to Chiang’s tomb
During the rule of the Kuomintang government, visiting the tombs was a major event, presidents lead the chiefs of the five branches of the government in a memorial at the tombs. Though following Taiwan's gradual shift towards democracy the visits to the tombs have become more and more simple and forlorn. After the Kuomintang lost control of the government the event even became an activity only for the Pan Blues; the DPP government not only didn’t visit the tombs, they didn’t even hold similar ceremonies.
Lien Chan: “would be pleased to visit the mainland”
Because KMT Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kun’s recent visit to mainland China caused such mixed reactions in the political arena, the question of when KMT Chair Lien Chan would visit the Chinese mainland was also a hot topic. After paying his respects Lien expressed that he was honored by the invitation to visit the mainland, but a time frame for the visit is still awaiting further confirmation: "I would be pleased to accept such of visit, and go on a 'journey of peace, the time (of the trip) should be in the near future, as for how to determine the time for certain, it will require contact from both sides to decide."
James Soong: don’t rush
As for the People First Party chair James Soong, who in the month of February held talks with President Chen Shui-bian in the so-called “Chen-Soong meeting”, appeared conservative in answering questions about himself visiting China: “Which party wants to rush to go first, the PFP wont do like others did and try to go against the policy, today we hope to place policy before politics.”
Soong also said that the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China is very complex, and the KMT and DPP both can’t solve the problem within fifty years or five years. The PFP hopes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can benefit; he said he believes that a relationship between the two sides is not a one-sided wish, and hopes it can take place in an atmosphere in which both sides desire not to encroach on the dignity of Taiwan. Soong also stated that he will soon be able to meet with Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan to discuss the Taiwan Strait situation.
John Chiang: tombs should become a “tomb containing clothing without the body,”
Also worth mentioning is the discussion about what will be done with the mausoleums of the two Chiangs once their bodies are moved to Wutzushan military cemetery. John Chiang, Chiang Ching-kuo’s illegitimate son, said that he hopes the Taoyuan County government will be able to maintain the original spirit and cultural spirit of the mausoleums. He also suggested that once the bodies are moved, the tombs become a “tomb containing clothing without the body,” and hopes the places will remain open to the public so they can remember the ways of their predecessors.

ABC to move Internet news network back to U.S. TVs

April 6, 2005
The U.S. television network ABC says its 24-hour news network, "ABC News Now", will become a permanent 24-hour television news network starting in July. Currently, the operation is only available on the Internet as a streaming media web site.
The network started as a experiment by the Walt Disney Company-owned ABC in the summer of 2004 during the U.S. presidential campaign nomination conventions. It was mostly broadcast as a subchannel or shared channel within the bandwidth of an existing digital television (DTV) channel already owned by ABC. For instance if the local ABC affiliate is on Channel 7 with a DTV channel of 23, then "ABC News Now" may have been available on digital channel 23.1, sharing the same bandwidth.
Because few households in the U.S. are equipped to tune in digital over-the-air sub-channels, and virtually none are carried on local cable companies, ratings were low for the fledgling digital channel. Adding to that technical difficulty, cable carriage of the network was small. "ABC News Now" was delivered to only 6 of the 110 million U.S. households via cable. Most viewers of the network, 30 million at last count, watched the network via the Internet.
Citing money reasons, ABC shuttered the over-the-air "ABC News Now" broadcasts in January to focus on building the web-based service. But come July, ABC plans to return its news network and its 20 original programs to local TV stations. Without any commitment from national cable or satellite companies, ABC will return to digital sub-channels on local DTV transmissions.

Nigeria destroys illegal small arms

April 6, 2005 
Nigeria is cracking down illegal firearms, the Xinhua news agency reports.
So far this week the Nigerian government has destroyed 2,738 small arms and 5,368 rounds of ammunition, primarily in the troubled Niger Delta region.
The government began a project last October to rid the country of illegal arms and Tuesday's news will bring the total weapons seized and destroyed to 4,678 along with 8,256 rounds of ammunition.
Nigerian Defence Minister Rabiu Kwankwaso told local Nigerian newspaper Vanguard, this was "the highest single destruction ever". He added: "The war against the proliferation of illegal arms and ammunition is being won by the government."
The government will continue to "recover and destroy illegally acquired arms in order to engender a peaceful and secured environment for socio-political, economic and cultural development," Kwankwaso continued. 
The Niger Delta holds most of the country's oil reserves, which makes Nigeria the eighth largest producer in the world. Fighting in the region claims over 1,000 lives a year.
Residents of the Niger Delta have been fighting armed campaigns against oil companies that have begun oil production in the area. They claim that they have been inadequately compensated, that the land and water are being polluted, and that the Nigerian police and military have been acting in collusion with the oil producers to attack local villages, and torture and execute campaigners.

Toronto transit union threatens strike for Monday

April 6, 2005 
Bob Kinnear, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, said today that Toronto, Ontario, transit workers may begin striking as early as this Monday. A strike of the 8 400 employees would leave approximately 1.3 million daily riders looking for other means of transportation and clogging city roads.
The union voted down the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) offer March 9 with a 99% vote in favour of a strike. The five-year offer was said to include a two per cent wage increase in each of the next three years. The union said it wanted increased pension contributions and more leniency in scheduling. The union has now been in a legal strike position since April 1 but has said it would withhold strike action as long as serious negotiations were taking place. Today "Canadian Press" reported that TTC vice-chairman Joe Mihevic said the two sides were in "heavy, heavy" negotiations but going well and hoped they would continue.
Mr. Kinnear, however, announced a noon Friday deadline for a contract and told reporters that he feels the commission has been "dragging their heels on issues that they absolutely know are key to a settlement". He characterized the commission's negotiations as a "strategy of delay, defer and ignore".
The most recent TTC strike was in 1999 and jammed city roads for two days before the provincial government ordered the union back to work.

Swift mission measures distance to star explosions

April 6, 2005
In another first for the NASA-led space telescope mission called
Swift, five months into its mission it measured the distance to two
gamma-ray bursts (GRB), back to back, from opposite parts of the sky.
The GRB's are over nine billion light years away from the Earth.
The measurements were obtained utilizing the Ultraviolet/Optical
Telescope (UVOT).
"Swift will detect more gamma-ray bursts than any satellite that has
come before it, and now will be able to pin down distances to many of
these bursts too," said Peter Roming, UVOT Lead Scientist at Penn
State. "These two aren't distance record-breakers, but they're
certainly from far out there. The second of the two bursts was bright
enough to be seen from Earth with a good backyard telescope."
The Swift science team said these types of distance measurements
will become routine, allowing scientists to create a map to understand
where, when and how these brilliant, fleeting bursts of light are
created.
Gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful
explosions known in the Universe, are thought to signal the birth of
black holes; either from a massive star explosion or a merger of
smaller black holes or neutron stars. Several
appear each day from Earth's vantage point. They are difficult to
detect and study because they occur randomly from any point in the sky
and last only a few milliseconds to about a minute.
Swift, with three telescopes, is designed to detect bursts and turn on
its own to focus its telescopes, within seconds, on the burst
afterglow, which can linger for hours to weeks. The UVOT is a joint
product of Penn State University and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in
England.
Swift detected the bursts on March 18 and 19, as indicted in their
names: GRB 050318 and GRB 050319. The UVOT team estimated that the
redshifts are 1.44 and 3.24, respectively, which corresponds to
distances of about 9.2 billion and 11.6 billion light years. (The
second estimate reflects a more precise measurement made with the
ground-based Nordic Optical Telescope.)
Distance measurements are attained through analysis of the burst
afterglow.
Swift detected 24 bursts so far. GRB 050318 was the first burst
where the UVOT detected an afterglow. The lack of afterglow detection
is interesting in its own right, Roming said, because it helps
scientists understand why some bursts create certain kinds of
afterglows, if any. For example, Swift's X-Ray
Telescope (XRT) has detected afterglows from several bursts. The UVOT
detected afterglows in GRB 050318 and GRB 050319 in optical light, but
not significantly in ultraviolet.
"Every burst is a little different, and when we add them all up we
will begin to see the full picture," said Keith Mason, the U.K. UVOT
Lead at University College London's 
Mullard Space Science Laboratory.
Mason said UVOT distance measurements will become more precise in
the upcoming months as new instruments aboard Swift are employed.
Swift is a medium-class explorer mission managed by NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Swift is a NASA mission with
participation of the Italian Space Agency and the Particle Physics and
Astronomy Research Council in the United Kingdom. It was built in
collaboration with national laboratories, universities and
international partners, including Penn State; Los Alamos National

Prince Rainier III of Monaco has died

April 6, 2005 
His Serene Highness Prince Rainier III (Rainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi) of the Principality of Monaco has died. Prince Rainier has been prince of the tiny Mediterranean country for almost 56 years. He was 81 years old.
He died at 0635 local time (0435 UTC) at the Centre Cardio-Thoracique de Monaco with his son Prince Albert by his bedside. He had been hospitalized since March 8, 2005 and his health declined steadily since then. He had been suffering from heart, kidney and lung problems. 
Prince Rainier is famed for being the husband of the late Princess Grace (Grace Kelly), and for investing in business at a famous gambling centre. He was on the throne since 1949, making him one of the longest reigning monarchs in Europe.
Prince Rainier is succeeded by Prince Albert II, who has already been serving as regent since March 31.

Militants attack Kashmir bus route safe house

April 6, 2005
Islamic militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a government guesthouse sheltering passengers on the first bus in 50 years to cross between the Indian and Pakistani sides of Kashmir.
Authorities say the bus will depart as scheduled Thursday. The attack occurred in Srinagar on the Indian controlled side of Kashmir.
It is unclear whether the passengers or any others in the building, which housed several offices, were injured.
Four Islamic militant groups claimed responsibility later in the day for what they said was a suicide attack on the building complex. So far there has been no information from Indian security personnel as to how the attack was carried off.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to come to Srinagar to see the bus off on Thursday despite the attack. Another bus is due to depart from the Pakistani side of Kashmir, bound for India, later the same day.
One bomb exploded along the route yesterday and two other were defused.

Iraq elects Kurdish president, Saddam said to be shaken

The Kurdish population of Iraq celebrated today the appointment of veteran Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani as the country's new president. The confirmation comes after Iraqis braved suicide bombings and other attacks to vote on the future of their country's Government more than two months ago. As well as electing Talabani, Iraq's Parliament also appointed Shi'a Adel Abdul Mahdi and Sunni Arab tribal leader Ghazi Yawar as vice presidents.
"This is the new Iraq -- an Iraq that elects a Kurd to be president and an Arab former president as his deputy," said Parliament speaker Hajem al-Hassani earlier. During Saddam Hussein's rule, the Sunni minority dominated Iraq, while Shi'ite communities were oppressed and the Kurdish population massacred as they fought against Saddam's regime. The Kurds make up 20 percent of the country's population, while Shi'ites make up 60 percent and the Sunni Arabs make up between 15 percent to 20 percent. Reports say Talabani has pledged to work with all ethnic and religious factions to rebuild Iraq and has called upon neighbouring countries to stop insurgents from further disrupting Iraq.
Although his post is seen by some as a ceremonial position, Talabani's role will include overseeing the completion of Iraq's new constitution by August this year and appointing Shi'ite leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari as Iraq's prime minister.
Echoing the comments of many Kurdish Iraqis, Mohammed Saleh, a 42-year-old Kurd in Kirkuk, told reporters: "Today Jalal Talabani made it to the seat of power, while Saddam Hussein is sitting in jail. Who would have thought."
According to agency reports, Saddam Hussein, imprisoned at a U.S.-run high security facility on the outskirts of Baghdad, was said to be "clearly upset" as Iraq moved closer to becoming a democratic state again. Watching the election results unfold live on Iraqi television, Saddam "realised that it was over, that a democratic process had taken place and that there was a new, elected president," Iraq's human rights minister Bakhtiar Amin told Reuters earlier today.

Canada presses Iran for an international investigation into Kazemi death

April 6, 2005&lt;br&gt;
Canada pulled out of a trade conference with the Iranian Government after discussions surrounding the alleged torture and death of photo-journalist Zahra Kazemi fell through. The move comes after accusations by Canada that a Canadian journalist, Kazemi, was savagely attacked in Iran. The allegation was denied by Iran's Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi on Tuesday. Canadian ministers have since responded by calling for an international forensic investigation into the Kazemi case.
"We will continue to put pressure on Iran," Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew said yesterday. "This is something on which we will not give up. We know that in Iran it is lies, it is coverups that are being presented to us."
The allegations stem from Iranian born Doctor Shahram Azam, who fled to Canada and revealed last week how he examined Kazemi in June 2003, following her arrest in Iran. Azam told reporters that Kazemi was brought to him by Iranian authorities with severe injuries that were said to have been inflicted whilst in custody. Kharazi dismissed Azam's claims, adding that he has never worked at the hospital in which he claims he treated Kazemi.

Space Shuttle Discovery resumes rollout to launch pad

NASA reports that the Return to Flight mission has started to roll toward the launch pad once again. 
The rollout of the shuttle , scheduled for April 5 around midnight local time, was moved forward as a precaution when a small crack was discovered in the foam insulation on an external fuel tank. Officials decided it was no reason for concern.
As of 2:04 p.m. EDT (18:04 UTC) today the orbiter began inching out of the Vehicle Assembly Building's hanger at in and onto the access road for the launch pad 39B. It is expected to reach the launch pad around 8 p.m. EDT.
The actual launch window for the 114th Space Shuttle flight, and the 31st flight of the orbiter Discovery, will be no earlier than May 15 to June 3, 2005.
The trip to the International Space Station, "Return to Flight" STS-114, will last 12 days and be the first flight since the tragedy in 2003. This flight will test a new robot extension arm, the -built Orbiter Boom Sensor System, used to repair the exterior of the International Space Station. 
 goes from standing still on the launch pad to more than 17,000 miles per hour in just over eight minutes. That means the astronauts go 2,000 miles per hour faster every minute.

Childhood exposure to TV linked to bullying

April 17, 2005 &lt;br&gt;
In an "Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine" report, economist Frederick J. Zimmerman Ph.D. and colleagues at the University of Washington, in Seattle, found there is a statistically significant relationship between bullying behavior by adolescents and the amount of TV they watched. While previous studies linking the phenomenon have been done before, this study used data from a US national longitudinal survey involving 1,266 four-year-olds, to provide what authors describe as "empirical support to theories that suggest that bullying might arise out of cognitive deficits as well as emotional ones," according to "NewsWise".
Of mothers who reported their children displaying bullying behavior, the study found that those watching 3.5 hours of TV a day were 25% more likely to bully, while those watching 8 hours or more were 200% more likely. The report based its findings on statistics of TV watching by children at age 4, and then compared that history to reports by mothers of their child's behavior between the ages of 6 to 11.
“The magnitude of the risk associated with television… is clinically significant,” the report's authors wrote. Bullying behavior by school children is thought by some to be a health problem.
The study also assessed parental factors that reduced the negative impact of watching television. These included taking children on outings and activities, reading to them, and regularly exposing them to new ideas. Results suggest that children receiving cognitive support were a third less likely to become bullies.
Another parental factor looked at was providing emotional support. Simple things like eating together and talking about topics important to children were found to have an effect.

Japan announces moon program

April 6, 2005
 announced on Wednesday a program to send astronauts to the moon by 2025. The plan calls for the establishment of a moon base that would be operated by Japanese astronauts and robots.
"Until now, the question has been, 'Can Japan develop its own manned spaceship?' We will know the answer in another 10 years," JAXA Chairman Keiji Tachikawa told the "Associated Press".
The plan includes the development of robots and nanotechnology, and calls for the design of a space vehicle to carry passengers and cargo to the moon. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) asked for a budget increase to about US$2.6 billion a year to fund the program.
Aerospace professor Taketoshi Hibiya, who works at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology, questioned the value of going to the moon.
"If you are hoping to exploit energy resources for example, the question is whether you gain more energy than you expend getting to the moon and back," Hibiya told "Reuters". "As scientists, we want to experiment with everything, including manned flight, if we can get the money," he said. "Unfortunately, the country's budget is in a bad way at the moment."
Japan is running a national debt of 751 trillion yen (US$6.94 trillion).
Japan said it would decide within 10 years whether it would pursue its moon program on its own, or if it would team up with other nations.
No country has sent a manned mission to the moon since the Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s. China and Russia are both planning moon programs of their own. China plans to send a satellite to the moon in 2007. Russia has a plan to send personnel to the moon sometime between 2015-2020 as part of a larger program to one day send a mission to Mars.
JAXA's next mission will survey the moon with the "SELENE" probe. The mission was scheduled to launch this year, but has been delayed for unknown reasons.

Italy urges pilgrims to avoid Rome city centre for Pope funeral

As many as four million pilgrims are expected to flock to Rome for the Pope's funeral Friday. Italian authorities have in response urged visitors to avoid entering the centre of Rome and instead use a special camp open on the outskirts of the city. Already one million people have arrived to see the Pope John Paul II's body lying in state and officials have said that it will be impossible for visitors arriving now to witness the funeral first hand.
"The city centre cannot take the arrival of any more faithful," Guido Bertolaso, head of crowd control for the funeral, said today. He added: "Anyone arriving tonight or tomorrow will have no possibility of following the funeral at St. Peter's."
The city of Rome, which is normally home to three million inhabitants, is said to now be focusing its efforts on tightening its security ahead of Friday's event. The 200 foreign delegates expected to be present at the funeral are said to be an attractive terrorist target, resulting in the closure of Italy's air space over Rome during the day, sources have claimed.
Speaking to the Associated Press, an official of the Rome prefect's office, which is responsible for coordinating the city's security said: "Precautions have been taken for airports, stations and all the other places where people gather." Authorities have also increased the number of law enforcement officers in the city centre for the occasion.

Iranian opposition group declares all acts of current government void

In a document dated March 30, 2005 by a group calling itself "the 70 million people of Iran," a declaration was issued asking the current government of The Islamic Republic of Iran to "...peacefully surrender the power to its rightful owners..." by June 16 of this year. The group's relationship to political parties in Iran is not known.
The document addresses the Supreme Leader Khamenei, Chairman Akbar Rafsanjani of the Expediency Council, and President Khatami, and enumerates the group's grievances against the regime. It threatens boycotts and blackouts throughout Iran on June 10 if there are no indications the regime intends to comply with its demands. Copies of the document have been furnished to the leaders of the EU, Russia, Japan and the United States.
The group alleges that elections that regularly take place in Iran are biased:, writing "Your own meaningless and rigged elections will be your undoing," but does not seem to propose constitutional changes. It uses words suggesting they plan to use violence, including extrajudicial execution, against the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and against the conservatives who dominate parliament: "Beginning on June 18 and every day thereafter, we shall strike like a furious flood to cleanse our nation from your filthy existence. ...if you have been so foolish to stay behind, you will experience our rage. Retribution will be swift for those who stay behind and stand in our way."
A separate document to the leaders of the G8 nations asks for their support, and promises armed resistance to the current government of Iran on June 18, 2005 if peaceful remonstrances fail to have their intended effect.
The source for the translation and dissemination of the documents into English, French and German calls itself the Iran of Tomorrow Movement (IOTM), an exile group operating from Encino, California in the United States. The group claims there are "2,195 resistance cells" operating in Iran and abroad.

April 7, 2005
ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings was diagnosed this week with lung cancer. Despite beginning out-patient treatment next week which will involve chemotherapy, Jennings will continue to front ABC's 'World News Tonight' show, "to the extent he can do so comfortably", says ABC News.
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer," Jennings told ABC staff on Tuesday. "I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated." The 66-year-old anchor man, who gave up smoking several years ago, added: "I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."
Jennings began his career at ABC News in 1964 and in 1983 was made senior editor and anchor of "World News Tonight". Due to ill health, he was unable to work during his network's special report on the recent death of Pope John Paul II.

Hackers crack Sony PSP to allow Internet chat, web surfing

 
Sony's recently introduced Playstation Portable has proved popular with curious geeks who discovered various talents hidden within the new handheld video console.
The biggest 'hack' so far has been the manipulation of a web browser embedded within the PSP game 'Wipeout Pure', which can be easily coaxed into accessing the majority of Internet via a suitable portal. Jonathan Terleski was able to monitor the digital conversation held between his PSP and Sony's website when the browser in his game 'Wipeout Pure' would try to download new software from Sony via the Internet. Using a suitably set up DNS server, Terleski configured his handheld console to access his own custom PSP portal, instead of Sony's website, and then invited other owners to use his gateway to the web. 
From this discovery, Robert Balousek later created a web based IRC interface that allows people to talk to each other and hold conversations in real time via the Internet on their PSP consoles. According to Reuters, his IRC website has to date been used by as many as 100,000 visitors and Balousek now plans to introduce a web based interface to the AOL instant messaging network for PSP users.
Other notable recent 'hacks' include reading ebooks and comics and watching pre-recorded television shows, taken from a TiVo, on the Sony PSP.
None of the 'hacks' have yet employed writing custom software for the device. So far, most are spin-offs of Jonathon Terleski's web browser hack. Other hacks, like the ebook reader and television show viewer, are made possible through use of the PSP's built in tools for viewing video and images. Sony has not yet released an SDK which would allow end-users to write 'homebrew' software, therefore hackers are tied to manipulating software included with the PSP or available through the games purchased separately.
Speaking to Wikinews, Jacob Metcalf, who documented the web comic's hack on his website, explained his motivation: "Web comics are already designed for on-screen reading and they have some of the same audience as people who play games - lots of the most popular web comics are about gamers, like PVP and Penny Arcade."
He added: "I do wish that [Sony] would come out with an actual web browser like the Dreamcast had. South Korea is going to get a real web browser and I have a feeling in my gut that there is going to be Internet software for the PSP like a web browser and email announced at E3 this year."

Bitmover ends free Bitkeeper, replacement sought for managing Linux kernel code

April 7, 2005 
Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer be providing a free version of its product.
As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he "decided to not use BK mainly because [he] need[s] to figure out the alternatives". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.
Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as "Linux" or "GNU/Linux". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.
While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).
According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is "personally very happy with BK, and with Larry [McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover]."

Western Australia apologises to abused wards-of-state

April 7, 2005 
The state Premier of Western Australia (WA), Dr Geoff Gallop, gave an apology to children physically and sexually abused in institutional care within the state between the 1920s and 1970s. The statement was given in reaction to an Australian Senate inquiry into institutional child abuse published last year.
"We acknowledge our state's history, the role played by the state in providing care for children and particularly past practices in the provision of care," Dr Gallop told "Australian Associated Press".
"We apologise to all those people who were harmed as children while in institutional care, and express deep regret at the hurt and distress caused. We recognise that the effects of physical, psychological and sexual abuse did not end when these children became adults."
Many of the children had been placed in care by government agencies.
"Overwhelmingly, the (submissions) make tragic and distressing reading. They tell of neglect, of shocking abuse, of predatory behaviour from so-called carers and of criminal activity," Senator McLucas told federal parliament at the time of the "Forgotten Australians" report, last year.
"The evidence is also there that authorities in the church and in governments either knew or should have known that much of this horrific activity was occurring."
The inquiry found that an apology was an important symbolism in recognising past wrongs and helping victims gain closure, according to an "ABC News" report. And Dr Gallop said the victims' personal histories must be heard and acknowledged in order to build a better care system for the future.
WA's Community Development Minister, Sheila McHale, said those wishing to find out about their time in care in WA as children should contact the Department for Community Development, which is also providing counselling services to those who were abused in an institution.

FBI starts investigation of charges of shoddy work on new SF Bay bridge

April 7, 2005 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of a new $1.5 billion "skyway" portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, according to a report published in the "Oakland Tribune." The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island. There are so far no criminal charges filed.
The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities they were pressured – and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 – for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined the work, although rushed, met safety standards.
"We've got good welds, good procedures and everything is in place to have a quality product. If a defect got in, we can't find it," Pete Siegenthaler, Caltrans project manager told the Tribune in an interview. A KFM spokesman told the "Tribune" that the welds are in "compliance with stringent Caltrans specifications."
According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was spent during its construction.
If questionable welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt.
The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At $6.2 billion total, the new bridge qualifies as the largest public works project in California's history.

Separatists fail to stop re-opening of Kashmir bus service

April 7, 2005
A bus service successfully crossed the disputed region of Kashmir today despite coming under attack early on in its journey. It is believed Islamic separatists launched grenades at the Indian run bus minutes after it left a station in Srinagar, although the coach continued on to Muzaffarabad after it survived without damage. Whilst its passengers escaped unhurt, the attack is understood to have injured four other people, including a policeman. Indian authorities also located and defused at least one explosive device placed along the bus route.
The service, the first of its kind in almost 60 years, transported Pakistani and Indian Kashmiris across the conflict torn region, passing the cease fire line between India and Pakistan, dubbed the 'Line of Control'. The bus trips, which run to and from Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, are seen as a major step forward in the growing peaceful relations between India and Pakistan. The two nuclear powers both seek to control the Kashmir region, which has been a flashpoint for conflict for over 50 years. 
"A door has opened," said Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today as the bus set off from Srinagar. "Pakistan and especially President General Pervez Musharraf have helped us open this door and without their support, the door would not have opened. This is the beginning of a new phase. Violence is not going to solve any problems." 
Anti-Indian separatist Kashmiri militants have branded the return of bus service as a "betrayal of peace", according to reports.
Earlier this week, guerrillas attacked a Government safe house where the bus' passengers were said to be staying.

Brazilian cardinal criticizes President after inquired about Brazilian Pope

April 8, 2005&lt;br&gt;
Brazilian cardinal Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid, Archbishop of , harshly criticized Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after arriving in Rome on Tuesday. The criticism was in response to a journalist from the Brazilian newspaper "O Estado de São Paulo" who asked if it was now time for Brazil to have a after having a worker President.
Dom Eusébio said: "No, don't put Lula [the Brazilian Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva] in this story, not yet. You'll mess up everything because he and the Holy Spirit don't agree that well. Do you think that he knows the Holy Spirit?"
Eusébio, commenting on the Brazilian President's opinions about the new Pope, said "Lula shouldn't try to interfere or give hunches." He also added that, "Lula doesn't have a straight faith. His attitudes are not logical under our faith. His faith isn't cultivated. Lula is not Catholic, he is chaotic."
He went on to criticize the government, saying "Lula is very poorly advised. We are almost under a dictatorship because everybody is from PT [the Workers' Party]... I have some doubts about Lula's words. Politicians say one thing one time and they say other things later."
On Brazilian foreign policy, Archbishop Eusébio said: "It is extremely towards the left... [I think about the visit of President Lula da Silva to in ] that they were two fools meeting each other. The Left has never benefited anyone. Look at , and Cuba."
The Brazilian cardinal Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid has been discussed as a possible , or one who could become Pope, though he has said "Nobody wants to be Pope. Who wants to be Pope?"
Until Wednesday, the Brazilian government declined to comment on Dom Eusébio's interview.
Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid, along with Dom Cláudio Hummes who is Archbishop of , tried to play down the statements on Wednesday. Dom Eusébio said of the interview, it was made on an inappropriate occasion, after a long, tiring flight and that he didn't want to disrespect the government. According to Dom Eusébio, the succession of John Paul II is not a subject which the President should address. Dom Cláudio said that President Lula "is" Catholic, in his way. 
Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid is 73. He will take part on the that will choose the new Pope. Dom Cláudio Hummes, 71, is seen as a serious Latin-American candidate to the succession of Pope John Paul II.

Australia appeals for no execution in Indonesian drug case

A 27-year-old former beauty student from the Gold Coast of Australia faces the death penalty. She was allegedly caught at Bali airport importing marijuana from Australia in October. Appearing before an Indonesian judge after authorities found 4.1kg of high-grade cannabis in her unlocked boarding bag, she could be sentenced to death by firing squad, the maximum penalty for the crime.
With that possibility looming for Ms. Corby, her father journeyed to her side, and an anonymous email petition was distributed around Australia and overseas, calling on the Australian government to ensure that, innocent or guilty, Ms. Corby is returned to Australia to escape execution.
An Australian witness who volunteered information which he says will endanger his own life, has testified that Schapelle Corby was unwittingly caught up in a domestic Australian drug-running operation gone wrong. The man alleged that Australian airport workers had placed the contraband in her luggage after it had been checked-in, with the drugs to have been removed before the luggage left Australia. 
Ms. Corby, who says she is innocent of the charges, staggered and paused to vomit while being led through a throng of journalists watching her trial in Jakarta, Indonesia, earlier today.
"I'm really sick," Ms. Corby told Densbar's head judge Linton Sirait, who told her to take better care of herself in jail so she would not get diarrhea. "Don't be stressed," Judge Sirait added as he adjourned the trial until April 14.
Her sister said a doctor would visit her in prison to assess her condition. Her father, suffering with prostate cancer, said it was difficult to watch his daughter struggling so hard when things were nearing the "nitty-gritty now."
He added: "The stress and the whole thing and the stomach cramps and the nerves. It's getting on top of her."
Australian politicians, noting the public support thrown behind the Gold Coast citizen, are promising to take her case up on several issues with the Indonesian Attorney-General later today. However, Mr. Corby expressed doubts that politicians could work things out: "It depends on what they call justice here [in Indonesia]. It looks a bit fairyland to me."
"Everything's reversed here. You're guilty until you're proven innocent," commented Mr. Corby in Indonesia. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is said to be monitoring the case to ensure the court hands down a just and fair verdict.

Wikimedia announces Yahoo! support

April 8, 2005
The Wikimedia Foundation and Yahoo! announced on Thursday they reached an agreement by which Yahoo! will provide hosting capacity to Wikimedia. 
Yahoo! will dedicate a significant number of servers in one of its Asian facilities for hosting Wikimedia's free content websites. Jimmy Wales, CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, says this generous donation will be of particular benefit to the vibrant and growing community of Wikipedia users in that part of the world.
The Yahoo! donation is a gesture of support for the charitable goals of the Wikimedia Foundation, and does not imply any ownership of the content. They do not expect Wikimedia to host advertisements in return for this support.
As of April 7, Yahoo! will also test the integration of Wikipedia content in its French-language "Yahoo! Search" shortcuts, to be followed by other languages to accommodate users in Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the United States. The shortcuts will show contextually relevant abstracts of Wikipedia articles in response to user queries.
Yahoo! is one of the Wikimedia Foundation's earliest corporate supporters. The relationship began last year with Yahoo!'s integration of Wikipedia into its Content Acquisition Program.

At least four killed by bomb thrown from motorcycle in Cairo

April 7, 2005
Four people were killed today after a bomb was hurled into a busy bazaar in Cairo, Egypt. The blast occurred near the al-Azhar mosque and injured at least an additional 18 people. The bomb is thought to have been thrown from a passing motorcycle, which then landed amongst crowds of tourists and shoppers gathered on al-Moski Street, in Cairo's ancient Muslim centre.
Rabab Rifaat, an Egyptian woman who witnessed the carnage, said she heard "a boom, a horrible sound, very loud", immediately before seeing body parts flying through the air.
The explosion was followed by a grisly scene, according to doctors who say a French female tourist killed by the bomb arrived at a local hospital in an "unrecognizable state". At least one man died of his injuries later in hospital, sources claim, while hundreds of police sealed off the scene. The Egyptian Government later confirmed that four French, three Americans, an Italian, a Turk and nine Egyptians were injured in the blast.
The al-Azhar mosque is regarded as being an important Islamic learning institution. Last October, 34 people died when Islamic militants bombed several hotels in the Sinai peninsula, targeting tourist hotspots in Egypt.
Egyptian officials are continuing to investigate the attack.

US House committee approves daylight saving time amendment

The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment on Wednesday to extend daylight saving time by two months. The bipartisan measure is sponsored by Representative , Republican of Michigan, and Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.
"The more daylight we have, the less electricity we use," Representative Ed Markey said. Markey also supported the measure by pointing out the business benefits. "There's more economic activity, because people feel they can walk around safely," he said.
"Extending daylight-saving time makes sense, especially with skyrocketing energy costs," Rep. Fred Upton said.
The bill extends daylight saving time to begin on the first Sunday in March and to end on the last Sunday in November. Daylight saving time currently begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October.
The estimates that extending daylight saving time would save 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The United States consumes approximately 20 million barrels of oil per day.
The House is planning to approve the energy bill to which the amendment was attached in several weeks. Several other amendments to the bill are still being debated.

FDA mandates &quot;black box&quot; for Celebrex, pulls Bextra off market

April 7, 2005
Drug giant Pfizer’s two blockbuster Cox-2 inhibitor drugs, Celebrex and Bextra, were both cited by the Food and Drug Administration for safety problems, particularly for long term users.
Last Thursday the FDA allowed Pfizer to keep Celebrex on the market if it added the “black box” warning to the physicians’ guideline. This warning is the strongest the FDA can give to doctors, and focuses on the increased chances of cardiovascular problems and gastrointestinal bleeding. Doctors should use the lowest possible dosage of Celebrex and for the shortest time necessary, it adds.
Meanwhile, Bextra was taken off the market today. Bextra users were told to stop taking the drug, according to reports.
Pfizer agreed to mandates by a blue ribbon panel of specialists, convened in February, to review the risks associated with the popular Cox-2 class of painkillers. The pills are taken by 50 million people worldwide.
The actions by the FDA are attributed to charges the agency was too slow and allowed manufacturers to report problems voluntarily. It also comes as other experimental Cox-2 drugs emerge, such as Merck’s Arcoxia and Novartis’s Prexige, and seems to raise the requirements for their future approval.
Critics said the Cox-2 inhibitors were over-prescribed and offered no more relief than cheaper over the counter medications such as ibuprofen.
Pfizer Inc "(NYSE Symbol PFE)" was trading at 26.90 at close on Thursday, up 0.15%

Ethiopia plans to expand country's Internet access

At an information technology conference in Addis Ababa, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia vowed to offer universal Internet connectivity in the country within three years. The government is working with a United States technology company to fulfill this promise.
The government will invest US$40 million in the venture, which will lay nearly 10,000 of cable. Ethiopia currently ranks low in Internet penetration, with just 30,000 connections available for its 71 million inhabitants. Part of the program is the installation of Internet access at 450 secondary schools throughout the country.
Zenawi explained the change of heart that led to the decision to invest in this infrastructure project. "Not long ago many of us felt that we were too poor to seriously invest in information and communication technology," he said at the conference. "We were convinced that we should invest every penny we have on securing the next meal for our people. We did not believe serious investment in ICT had anything to do with facing the challenges of poverty that kills. Now I think we know better," he explained to the delegates.
Not everyone thinks that the government knows better. Giovani Peri, Assistant Professor of Economics at University of California, Davis, specializes in macroeconomics and growth theory. Peri believes that the Ethiopian government may be misguided in its direct investment in the build-up of information technology, and should instead create incentives for the private sector to build such infrastructure.
Professor Peri likened the Internet access project to previous failed attempts by African governments to stimulate growth via large-scale projects. "[African governments] in the past tried to build airports ... in the middle of desolation." — but people need to know that the environment is right for business, he said, not just a good airport. He said that the investment in Internet access might be too early for that country, and that before it is built, the country needs a good educational system to get the scientific community involved in the process of building technology infrastructure.
Ethiopia's population is mostly rural, and over half of the population is illiterate. The country's per capita is US$560.

First Iraq Medal of Honor recipient receives memorial headstone at Arlington

US Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith was honored at a ceremony on April 5 at Arlington National Cemetery, where a memorial headstone was unveiled by his widow Birgit, and their two children Jessica, 18, and David, 11.
The headstone is a special, gold-lettered memorial tombstone, one of only six such markers to be found in Arlington. The inscription states, "In Memory of Paul Ray Smith...His Spirit Lives Forever."
Smith was honored posthumously by President George W. Bush on April 4, 2005 with the highest citation for valor that can be bestowed by the US Armed Forces, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during Operation Iraqi Freedom on April 4, 2003, the day of his death. During a ceremony in the White House, President Bush presented the award to Smith's family and described him as "a soldier whose service illustrates the highest ideals of leadership and love of our country."
Smith's death occurred while leading a defensive battle against over 100 of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard. While attempting to build a holding area for enemy prisoners of war about a mile from Baghdad International Airport, Smith and the three dozen men he commanded in the 3rd Infantry Division were surprised and outnumbered. 
During the Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, President Bush said, "With complete disregard for his own life and under constant enemy fire, Sergeant Smith rallied his men and led a counterattack. Seeing that his wounded men were in danger of being overrun, and that enemy fire from the watchtower had pinned them down, Sergeant Smith manned a 50-caliber machine gun atop a damaged armor vehicle. From a completely exposed position, he killed as many as 50 enemy soldiers as he protected his men."
"Sergeant Smith's leadership saved the men in the courtyard, and he prevented an enemy attack on the aid station just up the road. Sergeant Smith continued to fire...until he took a fatal round to the head. His actions in that courtyard saved the lives of more than 100 American soldiers...We count ourselves blessed to have soldiers like Sergeant Smith, who put their lives on the line to advance the cause of freedom and protect the American people."
The US Army has revealed many details about Smiths' actions that day. While his commander was on a reconnaissance mission, he led the defence of his platoon (and the mortar team, scouts and medical aid station based nearby) by throwing a grenade, firing rockets and firing his own weapon. After a Bradley Fighting Vehicle was forced to withdraw from multiple rocket-propelled-grenade strikes and a lack of ammunition, he ordered another soldier to reverse an armoured personnel carrier back into the scene of the fight, whose original crew had been incapacitated moments before by a mortar. Smith then engaged the attacking Iraqi troops using its roof-mounted un-armoured .50-calibre machine gun, knowing it was the heaviest weapon between the attackers and the troops behind him. Smith fired over 300 rounds before he was killed. The US Army states that his actions killed 20-50 Iraqi troops, and that his actions saved the many US troops stationed nearby.
In an unmailed letter home, Smith said that he was ready to give "all that I am to ensure that my boys make it home". His Medal of Honor citation was given, "For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty."
Smith was also the first ever to earn a Medal of Honor flag, a new award which will be given to all future Medal of Honor recipients since being authorized by Congress in a 2002 law. The flag is a simple design that consists of a blue field, fringed with gold, containing 13 white stars, similar to the Medal of Honor ribbon.

Cambridge, Mass., city council recommends construction firm W. R. Grace remain under DEP supervision for asbestos contamination

The Cambridge city council adopted a resolution on April 4 to request that the US Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) "take explicit account" of the activities of local construction firm W. R. Grace, which has previously contaminated an industrial area near the Alewife train station with asbestos. The council cited Grace's "extraordinarily extensive and well-documented history of contaminating sites and concealing the contamination" as the reason for its request.
The resolution was a reaction to a Response Action Outcome Statement and Risk Characterization (RAO) that W. R. Grace filed with the DEP. The Cambridge Chronicle recently took the filing as evidence that "the state seems poised to stop watching over" the contaminated site.
In February, W.R. Grace was indicted by a federal grand jury for contamination as a product of vermiculite mining operations in Libby, Montana, USA. The company was also charged with "concealing information about the health affects [sic] of its asbestos mining operations."

Sex, mental and physical exercise, fight dementia

Professor Perry Bartlett of University of Queensland's Brain Institute recommends sex, cryptic crosswords and a good run to stave off dementia.
The researcher, interviewed on Australian ABC radio today , said that with 52,000 Australians expected to be diagnosed with dementia by the end of the year, people wishing to ward off the degenerative disorder may benefit from activities which stimulate growth of new cells in the brain, accompanied by mental exercise to select for survival of the resulting crop of new cells.
"Quite prolonged exercise is very good to make new neurones," said the Professor. "These new nerve cells are really quite vital to our ability to function in the higher brain functions, such as memory and learning. Most of them die. We now know that we can preserve some of them by giving direct stimuli."
Professor Bartlett explained recent research findings, including those from collaborator Jeffrey D. Macklis at Harvard in the US.
"There are a lot of hormones and changes in blood that go up and down after exercise, and so that may be a lead to some of the chemicals that can drive the production of nerve cells.
"One of the chemicals that seems to promote neurogenesis is prolactin, and prolactin levels are very high in pregnant females. Prolactin levels, by the way, also go up during sex as well. So one could think of a number of more entertaining activities than running in order to regulate the production of nerve cells.
"Perhaps doing something a little more inquisitive or intellectual might be good at selecting their survival. So perhaps one should run a long distance and do the cryptic crossword or something like that," he said.
Professor Bartlett gave the same suggestions as being potentially helpful in depression, last year in an interview on the ABC "Science Show".

Police search home of Las Vegas woman who found finger in her chili at Wendy's

 police searched the home of Anna Ayala on Wednesday, looking for evidence related to her claim that she found a finger in her chili at a outlet. A dozen officers conducted the search at Ayala's home at Maryland Parkway and Serene Street at about 4 p.m. local time (23:00 UTC), according to witnesses at the scene.
"They put guns to us and handcuffed us and threw us to the ground in front of all my neighbors," Ayala told the "San Francisco Chronicle" on Thursday evening. "They treated us like trash, like terrorists. It's the worst nightmare," Ayala said.
"I've been dragged through the mud. We've been treated like animals. I've been through too much," Ayala told the "San Jose Mercury News" on Thursday evening.
Although police have not named Ayala as a suspect in the case, "San Francisco ABC 7" is reporting that the search warrant may be related to Ayala's dead aunt. Ayala disputed the ABC 7 report.
"I would like to know who she is and why I wasn't invited to her funeral," Ayala told the "Las Vegas Review-Journal". Ayala stated that she does not have a dead aunt. She also denied reports that a cooler had been seized from her home during the search. Ayala also said that her teenage daughter, Genesis Reyes, had torn shoulder ligaments as a result of the search. The "Las Vegas Review-Journal" ran a photo of Reyes wearing a sling in their Friday edition.
However, Ken Bono, a friend of the Ayala family, told the "Las Vegas Review-Journal" that police had taken a cooler during the search.
"Basically they kicked the door open. They pulled everything out of the closet," her roommate told a Las Vegas news crew, in a report aired on "NBC11 News".
In San Jose, police spokeswoman Gina Tepoorten confirmed to reporters that investigators had served the warrant in cooperation with Las Vegas police on Wednesday, but she refused to reveal specific details about the warrant.
"We're going to conduct a thorough investigation into this case and our investigators are talking to everybody involved, and that includes customers at Wendy's at the time as well as the finder of the finger," Tepoorten said.
Wendy's is offering a US$50,000 reward for information leading to the source of the finger.
"It's very important to our company to find out the truth in this incident," Tom Mueller, Wendy's president and chief operating officer told "Associated Press". "We believe someone knows exactly what happened, and hopefully the reward will encourage this person to come forward."
Wendy's claims that their internal investigation shows that the finger did not end up in Ayala's chili through any of the ingredients in their supply chain.
"With all the facts we have, we find no credible evidence to indicate that Wendy's was the source of the foreign object," Mueller said.
Business has fallen off dramatically at Wendy's outlets in Northern California since the finger was discovered on March 22.
"This has been an ordeal for all of us. Hopefully there will be a resolution soon," Wendy's spokesman Bob Bertini said.
The Wendy's outlet where the finger was found, located at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose, is owned by Fresno-based Jern Management.

Bill Clinton, the former President of the United States of America, will make a visit to Romania on May 21, to participate as the keynote speaker at the BeyondBorders 2005 conference in Bucharest. The conference will have the theme of "Branding a Country: Building a Reputation from Within" and is the inaugural BeyondBorders conference launched by the Brand Academy, the first Romanian institution dedicated to brand education.
Clinton's previous visit to Romania was July 11, 1997, when he visited the country to promote political and military integration around the time of the NATO Summit. He was the first US president to visit Romania since the Romanian Revolution of 1989 that overthrew the Communist regime.
The BeyondBorders 2005 conference will focus on strategies to brand Romania and promote it to the world. In recent years, Romania has realised the need for branding and for improving its image in the world in order to fuel prosperity. Branding would focus on building a reputation a positive reputation for the country abroad and emphasising its authentic values. The conference organisers hope that it will act as a springboard for an integrated national branding project for Romania.

Romanian president meets with EU officials in Bucharest

The President of Romania, , met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.
Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.
The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.
The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight . There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.
As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc.

Romanian PM and Siemens discuss Electroputere privatisation

The Romanian Prime Minister, Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu discussed on Thursday the involvement of Siemens in regard to the privatisation of Romanian locomotive company Electroputere. 
Electroputere, which is based in the southern Romanian city of Craiova, remains one of the largest state-owned companies in Romania after the fairly rapid privatisation process of 2003 and 2004. There have been attempts to privatise the locomotive manufacturer for a long time, yet all of them failed. However, Gabriel Zbircea, the president of the Authority for the Recovery of State Assets (AVAS) declared in March of this year that they would resume the privatisation process by dividing the company into four divisions, each to be sold separately. 
Siemens is expected to be a major potential buyer of Electroputere, especially regarding the magnitude of deals in transport infrastructure that the Romanian government has conducted up until now with the German corporation.

Funeral of Pope John Paul II takes place

The funeral of Pope John Paul II took place today in Vatican City, in front of St. Peter's Basilica. The Pope died on April 2 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and several other health problems.
Over four million people went to Rome to attend the funeral. The number of people present was so large that it was not possible for everybody to gain access to the funeral in St. Peter's Square. Several large television screens were installed in various places in Rome to let the people watch the ceremony. In many other cities of Italy and in the rest of the world, particularly in Poland, similar setups were made, which were viewed by a great number of people.
A large number of high-ranking representatives of many countries, as well as many representatives of the Roman Catholic Church and of several other Churches, were present at the ceremony. Among these were U.S. President George W. Bush, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, and French President Jacques Chirac.
The high number of people present in Rome and the presence of many important heads of state caused serious logistical and security problems for the Italian Government.
Speculation has already emerged that the late Pope may soon be made a saint; he has been referred to as "The Great," a title only bestowed on three of his 263 predecessors - and on none since the ninth century; many pilgrims in the crowd chanted "Santo! Santo!," expressing their desire for him to be elevated to this stature. Some pilgrims held banners reading "Santo Subito", meaning "Sainthood Now."
Following the funeral, the body of the Pope was laid to rest beneath St. Peter's Basilica in a private ceremony. Buried with him was a bag of commemorative medals and a scroll with an account of his life.

Visitors to popular tourist spots are warned to avoid large groups, the US Embassy in Cairo said in a statement issued today. A bomb blast yesterday in a Cairo bazaar killed 3 and injured 18. Police are still investigating the cause of the blast which appears to be the work of a single individual.
Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Ahmed al-Maghrabi, in an effort to calm the public told reporters, "people should not be scared away from this country." The explosion killed an American tourist, a French woman and the person who was probably the bomber.
The explosion occurred at al-Moski bazaar near the al-Azhar mosque, a popular tourist destination. The bomb was packed with nails, obliterating the person who detonated it. 9 people remain hospitalized, and nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast.

Spam mailer gets 9 year jail sentence

A , USA jury found a man, described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, guilty on Friday of the felony crime of using an alias to send massive bulk e-mailings. The 9 year prison sentence handed down by the jury was put on hold by the Circuit Judge Thomas Horne, allowing the perpetrator, Jeremy Jaynes of , , to seek an appeal.
Jaynes, who used the alias “Gaven Stubberfield” as well as others, peddled junk products and pornography. Prosecutors say he grossed up to $750,000 a month by sending at least 10 million emails a day using 16 high-speed lines. 
The case was prosecuted in Virginia because it is the home to the leading AOL, the company who instigated the charges. This is the first time a conviction has been gained using the legislation enacted in 2003 to curb bulk e-mail, aka , from unsolicited distribution into users mailboxes. 
Jaynes remains free on a $1 million bond while his case is appealed. Prosecutors differed with his attorneys on the prospects of Jaynes winning his appeal.
His attorney, David Oblon, though never denying that his client was in the “marketing” business, argued that nine years was too long to sentence an out of state resident for a law that had taken effect just two weeks earlier.
"We have no doubt that we will win on appeal," Oblon told reporters. "Therefore any sentence is somewhat moot. Still, the sentence is not what we recommended and we're disappointed."
Prosecuter Lisa Hicks-Thomas said she was pleased with the outcome and confident the law would be upheld on appeal.

&lt;br&gt;
Mean Fiddler PLC, one of the most successful music promoters in the UK and Ireland has today agreed to be taken over by the Irish owned Gaiety Investments (owner of MCD Promotions) and US based Clear Channel Communications. The deal values Mean Fiddler at STG£37.9m (€55.3m; US$71.4m) or £0.60 a share. It will be an all cash transaction.
Mean Fiddler was founded in 1982 by Vince Power, a native of County Waterford, Ireland. The company, which started life as a small but trendy club in London, grew rapidly in the 1980's to encompass a French restaurant and three venues in London; the Acoustic Room, the Powerhaus and Subterania.
Today the company regularly organises some of the largest music events in Europe. It runs the Reading and Leeds music festivals and also owns a 39% stake in the Glastonbury Festival.

Maine, USA, Land Use Regulatory Commission approves reconstruction of camps on protected Allagash River

The Maine Land Use Regulatory Commission (LURC) affirmed on April 6 its previous finding that two cabins on the Allagash River in northern Maine would be permitted to be rebuilt, the Bangor Daily News reports. The commission's initial decision had been appealed; with this decision, the appeal is rejected. The construction is contentious because the river has been protected by the state since 1966. According to the paper, the commission noted that the task of rebuilding the cabins had been listed in the 2003 River Driver's Agreement. The only mention of the so-called Taylor camps in the 3-page agreement is as follows, under the heading "Creation of Historical/Cultural Visitor Center": "Explore idea of Michaud Farm historic place, that could involve restoration of Taylor camps and historical demonstrations--canoe access only."
According to the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands, the Taylor camps are three log cabins built in the 1930s by Henry and Alice Taylor. Mr. Taylor worked as the Allagash game warden. The Bangor Daily News noted that the other buildings in the area, such as the Michaud Farm, are not included in the permit that was granted this week.
Local resident Gary Pelletier began reconstructing the cabins in the summer of 2004, but was halted by the appeal of the permit granted by LURC, according to the Bangor Daily News. Now that the appeal has been rejected, Pelletier will resume work. Pelletier is quoted by the Bangor Daily News as saying "We're going to gear up," in reference to his preparations for the reconstruction, Allagash resident and town selectman Roy Gardner that there was an ice jam in the river that he estimated was "ten feet thick" earlier this week, according to an article on April 6 in the Daily News.

Hundreds arrested following pro-democratic rally in Nepal

April 8, 2005
More than 500 activists, journalists, lawyers and students were arrested Friday in Nepal, whilst protesting against King Gyanendra's take-over of the country's government. Human rights groups have now called for a UN investigation into alleged abuses of civil liberties after King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency at the start of February.
"We see no sign that the rule of law is being restored," Nicolas Howen, secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists, said. "The appalling violence against civilians carried out by the Maoists and security forces continues and the democratic parties, human rights organisations and the media are still intimidated and controlled." 
The state of emergency was initiated to properly tackle Nepal's Maoist rebels who, according to King Gyanendra, seek to replace the monarchy with a communist republic. Fears are now growing that violence in the country will continue to increase and insurgency in Nepal has claimed the lives of at least 11,000 people since 1996. Arjun Karki, president of the Federation of Non-governmental Organisations in Nepal said today: "If they are suppressed, those who support democracy are forced to use other means. So those who repress democracy should really consider their actions first."
Elsewhere in Nepal today, soldiers repelled a rebel assault on one of their bases in the country's northwest, say reports.

UN forced to cut food rations to a million Sudanese

April 9, 2005
The UN's World Food Programme says it has received just US$275m of the US$468m it believes is needed to feed two million people in the Darfur region of Sudan. The shortfall will force the organisation to halve its non-cereal daily rations to ensure supplies will last through the coming summer period.
"We are very concerned about the negative effect this drastic ration cut will have on the health and psychological well-being of thousands of people, who are already weakened and traumatised by war," said Carlos Veloso, WFP's emergency co-ordinator for Darfur.
According to the UN, at least 180,000 people have died and more than two million have fled the conflict torn region of Darfur since fighting between black African rebels and Arab militia broke out in 2003. Emmanuel Akwei Addo, the UN's independent human rights expert in the Sudan, claimed yesterday that the 2000 African Union troops present in the remote region were unable to reverse the deterioration of security in Darfur.
He added: "The present situation in Darfur is said to be a time bomb, which could explode at any moment. The rebels have grown more intransigent, and security on the ground is getting worse. Aerial bombardment still goes on."

Pope's Brazilian cousins lament his death

Pope John Paul II has a Brazilian cousin living in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He is João Woidyla, 83, and he came to Brazil in 1914, before John Paul II was born in March, 18, 1920.
According to the story told by local news agencies, the Pope's last
name was Woidyla too, like João's. The Pope changed it to Wojtyła when he left Poland to avoid political persecution. The grandfather of João Woidyla is José Woidyla, who was brother of Pope's grandfather. João's family discovered the relationship when Karol was elected Pope. The pope himself recognized the relationship and sent him a letter.
Pope John Paul II has other cousins in Brazil too: Isidoro, Alfreda, Genoveva (João's wife) and Bolessuaf.
Bolessuaf, 86, likes to read the card written in Polish that he received from his cousin, the Pope.
"A great man, who always fought for the good of the others", he adds.
João and his wife Genoveva met the pope John Paul II during his visit to Brazil in 1980.
The cousins got very sad when they heard that the Pope was gone. "To me, he seems to be a brother, more than my own brother ", said Isidoro. João said about the Pope: "I think he did the work what should be done. I hope the next one works like him". He added: "It is like to lose a father, I am very sad".
According to "Folha de São Paulo", Brazilian government invited João to take part in the funeral of the Pope. He declined saying that he is afraid of flying in airplanes.

Bush EPA nominee abandons insecticide-on-children study after Senate hearing

Following a Senate hearing in which the Bush administration’s nominee for EPA administrator, Stephen Johnson, stoutly defended his plan to pay parents to document the effects on infants of insecticide use in the home, he reversed course and stopped the program.
Among the original requirements for the 60 families requested to be participants in the “Children’s Health Environmental Exposure Research Study” (CHEERS) study according to EPA were that they must:
This original version of the requirements can be viewed in the Internet Archive, a free online repository that creates copies of websites on a regular basis. The third requirement was reworded by November 2004, according to the Internet Archive: "Maintain your normal pesticide or non-pesticide use patterns for your household. We will not ask any parent to apply pesticides in their home to be a part of this study."
According to the above document, the area of Jacksonville/Duval County was chosen for reasons of existing year-round high usage of pesticides and other household chemicals within the home, as well as relevant data from existing prior studies. The study involved researchers visiting the home of participants, parents videotaping their children's activities with a supplied camcorder, children wearing a small "activity sensor", and parents collecting food and urine samples for detailed analysis of the effects of chemical exposure to common commercially available chemicals, primarily pesticides, on which "current information... is very limited" . 
Selection for the study began in fall 2004. As incentives for their participation in the planned two-year study, parents were to be given $970, a t-shirt, and other gifts, and would have kept the video camera at its conclusion.
Senate opposition.
Complaining that the study was necessary, Johnson yielded to two Democratic Senators who had threatened to block him, using all means available, from officially taking the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency, of which he is the acting head. The block on his nomination was lifted afterwards although some Democratic Senators would not say how they would vote on the final nomination.
Under his guidance, the EPA agreed to accept $2 million for the controversial $9 million CHEERS study from an industry trade group, the American Chemistry Council, which represents the chemical insecticide manufacturers. The study was to be conducted with the cooperation of the Duval County Health Department, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta.
Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Bill Nelson, (D-FLA), demanded the cancellation of the study as proof of Johnson’s acknowledgement of what she called a "gross error in judgment".
“The CHEERS program was a reprehensible idea that never should have made it out of the boardroom, and I am just happy that it was stopped before any children were put in harms way," Boxer said. She added that testing on humans should not be a part of any United States environmental policy.
"I am very pleased that Mr. Johnson has recognized the gross error in judgment the EPA made when they concocted this immoral program to test pesticides on children," Boxer said.
EPA review.
Work on the study was halted last November by Johnson while an independent review of the study's design was conducted at his request. Part of the reason for the study's current cancellation was what the EPA in its press release has termed "mischaracterization" of the nature of the study as though children were being deliberately sprayed with pesticides.
Johnson defended his approach, "I have concluded that the study cannot go forward, regardless of the outcome of the independent review. EPA must conduct quality, credible research in an atmosphere absent of gross misrepresentation and controversy. I am committed to ensuring that EPA's research is based on sound science with the highest ethical standards."
In November 2004, William Farland, an administrator with the EPA's research department, told "The Oregonian", "There's no suggestion that we are asking them to use pesticides. We simply want them to continue to carry out their day-to-day activities."

Who's the richest entertainer in Australia? The Wiggles of course!

The top money grossing entertainers in Australia in 2005 were not Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman, or Russell Crowe. In fact, it was four tot-time entertainers, the Wiggles, with their preference for bright colours and sing-along dance numbers. Their earnings level was estimated at AU$45 million over the last year by Australian publication "Business Review Weekly (BRW)", in its yearly who's-who ranking of the nation's top 50 entertainment earners.
"They got into the market early, they took time to understand their audience, not only children but the parents who pay for everything," "BRW" managing editor Tony Featherstone, said.
Though almost doubling her earnings from the previous year, Nicole Kidman only made second place, at AU$40m. And Crowe came in third, at "only" AU$27m. Fourth place was long-time heavy metal favourites, AC/DC, whose estimated income was AU$18m.
Another children's entertainment band, Hi-5 came in sixth with $15m, after Naomi Watts.

Mozilla Foundation prepares third Firefox security update

The Mozilla Foundation is in the final stages of preparing the third security update to the popular free Internet browser Firefox.
This update will fix a security issue highlighted by Internet security firm Secunia which allows remote users to read the memory of a computer running earlier versions of Firefox. Information such as the websites the user has recently visited or their e-mail addresses can easily be recovered.
Users can visit the Secunia website and use a test page to see if they are vulnerable and to study the kind of information that the flaw discloses. Secunia currently recommends disabling Javascript in the browser as a short-term measure against the bug.
The release will also fix some bugs discovered in version 1.0.2 and a selection of other security issues.
The third release, to be known as 1.0.3, comes hot on the heels of 1.0.2, released on March 23. As before, users will need to download and install the entire 4.7MB program from mozilla.org, rather than download a Microsoft-style patch. Mozilla is working on an update system that will make updating via smaller patches possible in the future.
This release has had a difficult birth, with initial versions preventing many popular Extensions (user-installed sub-programs that enhance the capabilities of the browser) from operating. Mozilla developers have worked hard on the issue and are now confident that they have plugged security holes in a way which will not cause inconvenience to users.

Time Warner/Comcast bid to snap up Adelphia cable service

April 9, 2005
A bid topping $17.7 billion was jointly proffered by Time Warner Inc. and Comcast Corporation on Thursday to buy beleaguered Adelphia Communications Corporation in an industry consolidation move. Adelphia is the fifth largest cable service provider in the United States with nearly 5 million subscribers.
The market-share grabbing bid trumps the previous Cablevision offer of $16.5 billion. The bid is under scrutiny by the presiding judge over the Adelphia’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and must also be approved by the company’s creditors owed in the range of $20 million.
The acquisition race to gain dominance in the cable service provider market is driven by the high cost of installation and maintenance of cable lines. Fiber optic networks deliver traditional entertainment programming over a cable wire and is becoming increasingly popular for broadband internet content. The growing trust and recognition of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) suggests phone service subscribers will eventually migrate to cable voice communication as opposed to keeping with traditional copper land lines. Telephone company operators are scrambling to keep up.
The largest percentage of the bid would be put up by Time Warner (TW), who could gain by getting subscribers from the valuable Los Angeles market currently owned by Comcast and Adelphia. TW can also simultaneously divest itself of a stake owned by Comcast in TW by making a tax-free swap using some of the newly garnered Adelphia subscribers.
While the consolidation would likely get a look by the government with an eye towards a growing monopoly in the market, it would doubtfully be blocked considering the existence of competing technologies. Competition exists in the form of still numerous television by airwaves usage, satellite providers, radio content companies, and telecom providers.
Adelphia suffered a corporate scandal in 1992 with similarities to the WorldCom fall. Members of the Rigas family, founders of the company, were alleged to have siphoned off millions of dollars and hidden $2.3 billion leading to the bankruptcy filing. John Rigas and son Timothy were convicted July of 2004 and await sentencing.

Drug-resistant infections on the rise in American hospitals

April 9, 2005 
A rise in flesh-eating staph infections has worried doctors about the possible spread of drug resistant bacteria.
Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as staph, is a bacteria that commonly causes skin infections in otherwise healthy people. However, as a persistent threat in hospitals, it tends to infect patients who are already sick and whose systems are vulnerable due to IV lines that pierce the skin. Doctors have already battled for years against drug-resistant strains of the bacteria, but the struggle has generally been confined to hospitals. 
Now, however, Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) has been spreading in communities outside hospitals. Cases have multiplied by 25 times since 1998 at the University of Chicago. A Los Angeles hospital documented 14 cases of the flesh-eating infection, where patients required substantial time in intensive care and surgery. The infections are particularly problematic because nearly a quarter of people who get a staph infection require hospitalization. 
Staph infections are spread much like other diseases, with crowded conditions, poor hygiene, and skin-to-skin contact most frequently to blame. At higher risk are prison inmates, homeless people, military personnel, and families with kids in day care. Athletes also have a higher risk, because sweating makes it easier for bacteria to infect the skin.

Hard drive technology breaks storage density record

Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the San Jose, California-based joint venture of storage vendor Hitachi and U.S. technology giant IBM, has set a new record for storage density at 230 gigabits per square inch (Gb/in2). The company has developed technology to implement a recording method known as perpendicular recording, which allowed the increase in density above the current ~130 Gb/in2 limit.
Techworld claims there is a race between Hitachi and Toshiba for who will get the first drives to market which use the technology. According to Hitachi, they expect, "to ship [their] first perpendicular recording product in 2005 on a 2.5-inch hard drive". Toshiba is also planning to ship a drive in 2005 that uses perpendicular recording.
According to Techworld, Toshiba will ship an 80 GB, 1.8" drive in 2005. Toshiba's 1.8" drives are used in portable electronic devices such as Apple's iPod, which is currently available in sizes 60 GB and smaller.
While all commercially available hard drives to date use longitudinal recording, perpendicular recording has roots in research done in academic circles over 100 years ago.
Hitachi Tech has produced a Flash animation that explains the rudiments of perpendicular recording in a music-video style.
Inspired by the 1970s "Schoolhouse Rock" series of educational animation shorts, the flash movie features whimsical moments with data bits and disk platters that speak and sing (not possible with today's technology), it also contains realistic details. Of no importance to the viewer, but perhaps of interest to some, the animation shows Texas Instruments' UC5608DWP chips visible briefly in the background. While TI's UC5608DWP 18-line SCSI terminator chips have been made obsolete by the new UCC5618, the chips are indeed designed for use in hard drives.

The Toronto Transit Commission is expected to strike Monday. The TTC workers union, the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, rejected a deal offered by TTC management. They last went on strike in 1999. The average daily ridership exceeds 1.3 million passengers.
The city of Toronto has prepared to help deal with the forecasted traffic congestion by opening up free parking for car-pools at 14 city-owned community centres, banning parking on some city streets, and opening up some bus-only lanes to car-pools.
The initial deal, which was rejected, offered a 2% wage increase over five years. With a huge turnout the union-members voted against accepting the offer with a 99% majority according to a press release by the union. The union rejected the latest offer Friday reported to be a three-year contract with raises of 2.75 percent in the first year, three percent in the second and 3.25 percent in the third.

Chinese rioters storm Japanese embassy in Beijing

As many as a thousand rioters attempted to storm the Japanese embassy in Beijing late Saturday, shouting "Boycott Japan!" and "Japanese pig come out!", throwing rocks and smashing guardhouse windows. Protesters proclaimed, "Chinese people shouldn't protect Japanese," at the 500-odd riot-police who had arrived to guard the compound, wire agencies reported.
The Japanese Government had been criticised earlier this week for approving a controversial history textbook that protesters, as well as many in China and Korea, say whitewashes Japan's wartime atrocities against China. Japan's ambassador to Beijing defended the textbooks, adding that they were produced by private companies and not the Japanese government.
The Chinese "People's Daily" provided a report about the events which led up to the riot. The report cited the protesters' demands to "safeguard [the] Diaoyu Islands"; "smash Japan's daydream" of on the UN Security Council; and boycott Japanese-made products.
Between six- and twenty-thousand had turned out for a peaceful, legal anti-Japanese rally earlier in the day, prior to the emergence of the full-scale riot.
"Our generation believes that China must stand up for its rights and stop being soft on Japan," Li Jiangchuan, a college student told "The New York Times". "Japan should stop lying about history and tell the truth," he said.
"Every Chinese feels anger at the way Japan ignores its own history and tries to occupy China's sovereign territory," Li Hongbo, 19, student at Tsinghua University, told "The New York Times". China and Japan have recently disputed ownership of the string of tiny Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which have natural gas reserves.
According to "New York Times"' reporter Joseph Kahn in Beijing, "Subsequent gatherings at the Japanese ambassador's residence and the Japanese Embassy appeared to have been organized without official approval and were considerably more tense, with the police closing off many roads and busing in reinforcements to maintain order."
Participants in demonstrations also attacked the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi branch and a Japanese restaurant whose waitresses wear kimonos, reported "Reuters". Thousands also threw stones at the home of the Japanese ambassador to China, Koreshige Anami, according to the "Kyodo News" agency.
Japan formally protested the event with the Chinese diplomatic mission in Tokyo. Chinese diplomats expressed regret that the protest had gotten out of hand.
"The fact that people took actions such as throwing rocks at the ambassador's residence as well as the embassy is not something that the Chinese government can accept," Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qiao Zonghuai was quoted as saying. 
"Representing the government, I offer my heartfelt sympathy and express my regret" he said.
"Some people in Beijing organised a demonstration themselves in protest against the wrong attitude and practice Japan had taken recently on the issue of its history of aggression," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang was quoted as saying .
"The Chinese government demanded the demonstrators to keep calm and sane, give voice to their attitude in a lawful and orderly way, and not to engage in excessive action," he said.
However, the "BBC" reported that the authorities had signaled "tacit acceptance, if not approval" by allowing Saturday's protest to happen in the first place. 
Reporting of at least the initial larger rally by Chinese government-operated media outlets such as "People's Daily" quoted above, was 'rare', according to a number of sources. As explained by Japanese "Kyodo News", "China's state media seldom reports on protest rallies inside China." 
Reports indicate that the initial protest was organised substantially by communication over the internet, including email, bulletin boards, and instant messaging. 
The demonstrations have been attributed a number of records for size-in-recent-years, including "largest to be held in the capital since a massive outpouring [of] anti-American sentiment in 1999, after the United States bombed China's embassy in Belgrade during the war against Serbia"; ; "the biggest protest against foreigners since [the same event]" ; "one of the largest protest events authorized by the Chinese government in years" ; and "the largest anti-Japanese demonstration in Beijing since the two countries normalized diplomatic ties in 1972" .

Gaza cease fire rocked by latest killing of youths

April 9, 2005
The two month old truce between Israel and the Palestinians is still intact after three teenagers were shot down earlier today while trying to smuggle firearms through the Egyptian border. Palestinians claim they saw the children attempting to fetch a football that had landed in a no-go zone near a refugee camp, in southern Gaza. Israeli army sources say the youths entered a forbidden area heavily guarded by Israeli forces near the border with Egypt. The teenagers were fired upon by soldiers after they ignored warning shots.
Militants responded by firing mortar shells at Jewish settlements in Gaza, although no one was injured.
The level of violence in the Gaza region had dropped significantly since the cease fire was agreed upon by both sides of the conflict. Islamic Jihad chief Mohammed al-Hindi said today: "So far, the Palestinian factions have not declared an end to the calm... but they are studying the issue anew because of continued Zionist aggression." Saeed Siyam, a Hamas leader in Gaza, told the "Associated Press": "The Palestinian people cannot stay silent in the face of this crime and it cannot pass without punishment."
"These kids were not playing soccer," said an anonymous Israeli army commander today. "You don't get there by accident."

Thousands march on Baghdad in anniversary protest

April 10, 2005
Tens of thousands of protesters waving national flags marched in Baghdad, Iraq on Saturday, the anniversary of the toppling of Saddam Hussein. Chanting "No, no to the occupiers," they massed at Firdos Square on the site where Hussein’s statue was pulled down two years ago today.
Central Baghdad shut down ahead of the march and Iraqi security searched most protesters before entering the city. US and other peace-keeping forces remained out of sight. The march, sponsored by the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, passed with no notable violence or arrests, and the crowd was dispersed by early evening.
There were simultaneously another 5000 protesters who marched in Ramadi, a city west of Baghdad.
Calling for the withdrawal of occupation forces, protesters aped the televised images of occupation forces by knocking down their own effigies of George Bush, Tony Blair and Saddam himself. The effigies were clothed in red — a symbolism they have been marked for death.
Iraqi Ali Feleih Hassan told the "Associated Press", "No one accepts this. I want them out. They have been here for two years, and now they have to set a timetable for their withdrawal."
The US has been unable to set a timetable and is determined to stay until they believe the country is secure. Muqtada al-Sadr, an opposition negotiator, ultimately ended an uprising after signing a peace agreement with US forces last August.

Australia unemployment at 30-year low, but under-employed also at 5.1%

Australian unemployment is at a 28-year low at 5.1 per cent, according to recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This has prompted debate over whether interest rates should increase . However, the number of underemployed still remains high, at 600,000 — that is, around the same 5.1 per cent figure when compared to Australia's labour market of 10 million .
Strong job growth.
According to the Employment Minister, Kevin Andrews, 1.6 million jobs had been created over the past nine years, including 330,000 over the last 12 months. 4
A report from his department which described the employment market over the 12 months to August 2004, as one of 'solid growth', said total employment increased by 2.1% over that year.
"Advertised vacancies increased for trade occupations, marginally decreased for professional occupations and decreased for associate professional occupations," reads the October 2004 "Australian Jobs Update" report.
"The strongest numerical rises in employment occurred in Health and Community Services (up 60 600), Construction (up 43 400) and Manufacturing (up 40 900) while the strongest rates of growth were in Mining, Personal and Other Services, and Health and Community Services."
Possible interest rate hike.
Although there is widespread speculation, AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver told Australian Associated Press that the strong job market did not necessarily mean that the Reserve Bank of Australia would hike up interest rates. 5
"The labour market is one of the last indicators to turn down, so we've already seen the economy slow down - particularly in the housing sector - and you would think that it is only a matter of time that we'll see a slowing in (jobs)," he said.
"I think the Reserve Bank will probably need to see clear evidence of wages growth coming through to inflation before they move again."
Many are under-employed.
The still-large under-employed category defined by the ABS includes a wide range of persons — anyone employed for less than 35 hours a week, willing and available to work additional hours. 6 7
A study by The Melbourne Institute found in 2001 that one employed person in six is under-employed, with 5 per cent of available worker-hours unutilised 8. This was associated with part-time employment for females, but with full-time employment for males.
The 2001 study found that part-time workers seeking full-time employment felt negative effects, "not far short of those attributable to unemployment".
Number of long-term unemployed has increased over past ten years.
Roughly 60% of the half-million-odd eligible for unemployment benefits in February were denoted as "long-term" unemployed, according to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. 9 Less were long-term unemployed in February than at the same time last year. In 2004 there were 1.43 long-term unemployed for every short-term unemployed, while in 2005 there were 1.34 .
But ten years ago, there were fewer long-term unemployed than short-term, with 1.07 short-term unemployed to every long-termer .

Panic in Sumatra after new earthquake

April 10, 2005
People living on the Indonesian island of Sumatra have fled their homes after an earthquake of magnitude of 6.7 hit the area earlier today. Although the quake was not powerful enough to cause a tsunami, the event sparked fears of a repeat of the December 26 magnitude 9.3 earthquake in which around 300,000 people died. Today's tremor struck 70 miles southwest of Padang, a city in western Sumatra, yet no damage has been reported so far.
An Indonesia Geophysics and Meteorology Agency official said: "Many people in Padang are panicking. People have left their houses, especially those living on the coast."
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, said in a statement: "Earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a few hundred kilometres of the earthquake epicentre." 
Scientists are cautious that another major earthquake could occur along the Indian Ocean faultline, which has seen a number of minor tremors since the December 26 quake. Although most countries have a contingency plan for earthquake related disasters, a tsunami warning system for South Asia will not be ready until the end of 2006.

South African former apartheid party dissolves

The former party of apartheid in South Africa, the New National Party (NNP), has finally been dissolved by a vote of the party's federal council on April 9, 2005. The vote was 88 in favor, 2 against, and 3 abstentions.
This follows a decision under the guidance of party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk last year to join forces with the ruling African National Congress party (ANC). "The forerunner to the NNP, the National Party, brought development to a section of South Africa but also brought suffering through a system grounded on injustice," said van Schalkwyk.
The NNP was the successor to the National Party, taking the new name in 1997 to distance itself from its apartheid past. The National Party was the governing party of South Africa from 1948 to 1994, and promoted policies of apartheid and the promotion of Afrikaner (white South African) culture.
Former South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk, who oversaw the end of apartheid during his tenure from 1989 to 1994 as its last white president, called for the creation of a new party to take the NNP's place. "I think there is a need to establish something to take the place of the National Party, but hopefully without the historical baggage which the National Party carried and which also played a role in its demise," said de Klerk.
Proportion of the NNP share of the national vote have been steadily dropping since 1994, when it received 20.4% as the National Party in the nation's first free multi-racial elections, to 2004, when it received 1.7%.
Other prominent South African parties include the ANC (African National Congress), ruling party with 69.7% of the 2004 vote; and the Democratic Alliance (DA), a liberal party which is the official opposition party to the ANC, and received 12.4% of the 2004 vote. Until being dissolved the NNP was the fifth largest party in the country.
Concerns have been expressed about the long-term unchecked dominance of the ANC and the possibility for corruption, with Business Monitor International expressing the view that, "While official graft is low by both global and African standards, the blurred
line between the government and the dominant ANC party gives plenty of scope
for abuses." 
Transparency International ranks South Africa at 44th on its list of corrupt countries in its 2004 Corrupt Perceptions Index, ahead of most African nations but behind Botswana (31st) and Tunisia (39th). For comparison, the United States ranks at 17th on the same list.

Death toll mounts in Nepal civil conflict

As many as 116 Nepalis have been killed in recent confrontations between Maoist guerrillas and government troops, according to recent estimates from multiple sources, including India's "The Hindu".
Approximately 113 bodies of Maoist rebels were recovered following a fierce battle between guerrillas and government security forces three days ago. The clash took place 550 kilometers west of Nepal's capital Kathmandu, when rebels attacked an outpost of the Royal Nepalese Army. Three government troops were killed.
Nepal's King Gyanendra seized power on February 1 for the second time, in what he described as a necessary act to prevent the country from falling to the insurgents. Gyanendra has promised that peace and democratic institutions would be restored within three years; however, he has currently suspended many civil liberties, arrested demonstrators, and used armed soldiers to censor the news media.
Nepal's army is under international scrutiny for potential violations of human rights, and some nations including India and the United Kingdom have suspended aid. The United States is considering revoking its military aid unless the government's emergency regulations are ended.
The United Nations will be sending human rights observers into the country per an agreement signed Monday by Louise Arbour, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Ramesh Nath Pandey, Nepalese Foreign Minister. "Breaking the cycle of serious and systematic abuses [by both the government and rebels] will be the first essential step toward achieving peace and reconciliation in Nepal," said Arbour.
As the "San Francisco Chronicle" has reported, the rebels have brought about the brutal deaths of countless villagers, causing terror throughout Nepal. More than 11,000 deaths are believed to have been caused during 9 years of violent conflict.
An army commander interviewed by the "Chronicle" stated, "We are winning this war," against the rebels. Reflecting on his statement, he immediately retracted this, declaring, "Nobody is winning," he says. "We are killing Nepalese, and they are killing Nepalese."

China anti-textbook protests grow larger

Chinese protests against the publication of a Japanese government textbook continued for a second day in China, (Sunday) as an estimated three thousand protesters marched on the Japanese consulate in Guangzhou. Thousands of protesters also marched in Shenzhen, throwing objects at Japanese businesses.
The protesters repeated their demands for a boycott of Japanese goods, to block Japan from obtaining a seat on the U.N. Security Council, and for Japan to change textbooks which they say whitewash Japan's war atrocities. Protesters burned Japanese flags while singing and shouting anti-Japanese slogans. They also carried anti-Japanese signs along with Chinese flags.
Chinese view the textbook as "whitewashing" the events and actions of Japan to cast them in a more positive light. 
The protests are against the , which is publishing a high-school textbook that refers to the Nanjing Massacre as an "incident" (translation) and de-emphasizes the roles of comfort women as well as the contemporary issues surrounding Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine, in honor of Japanese soldiers. 
The Japanese government has claimed that the demonstrations have an "anti-Japanese sentiment," for which China should apologise.
In , Japan formally summoned Wang Yi, China's ambassador to Japan, concerning China's actions on Sunday.
"We formally demanded China’s apology and compensation," said Japanese Foreign Minister . He also said that Wang Yi replied "No" when asked for an apology.
While not issuing a formal apology through diplomatic channels, Wang claimed that China did not approve of the violent aspects of the protests.
"The (Chinese) government does not agree with extreme action," he said.
Back in , the "People's Daily" reported that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang deflected blame away from China for the recent downturn in Sino-Japanese relations.
"Japan must adopt an earnest attitude and appropriate ways to deal with major principled issues concerning the feelings of the Chinese people," Qin said. "The Japanese have to do more things conducive to enhancing mutual trust and maintaining the relations between the two countries, rather than doing the reverse," he said.

Israeli president shakes hands with leaders of Syria, Iran at Pope's funeral

In controversial reporting by the Israeli media, , the President of Israel, reportedly shook hands with two Mideastern leaders, the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Syrian President , during his trip to the Pope's funeral on April 8. If true, it is a notable incident and the first time leaders of the two anti-Zionist nations of Iran and Syria have ever shaken hands with an Israeli leader. 
Syria is still technically in a decades-old state of war with Israel since an end to it was never officially declared. Peace talks between the two countries broke down in March 2000 when Bashar Assad's father, , rejected a peace proposal of former President . Since Hafez Assad's death in June 2000, peace talks have not resumed. 
Iran has had no diplomatic relations with either Israel or the United States since their in 1979.
The three leaders were seated near each other while observing the funeral by a coincidence of their alphabetical listing. "The Syrian president sat in the chair behind me ... we exchanged smiles and shook hands," said Katsav, according to the website of Israel's newspaper.
Katsav also claims he later shook hands and spoke with Khatami and Assad during the traditional Christian service exchange of peace. Katsav and Khatami, both born in the Iranian city of , share the Persian language. Katsav reportedly said when leaving, "the Iranian president held his hand out to me. I shook his hand and greeted him in Farsi."
Upon Khatami's return to Iran, he denied the handshake ever occurred, saying “These allegations are false like all the other allegations made by the Israeli media and I have not had any meeting with a personality from the Zionist regime,” according to the . "As reiterated time and again, we do not morally and logically recognize Israel which was created based on force and usurpation."
He continued with "[Iran] would not do anything against the Middle East peace plans ...but the world should know that as long as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized, these peace plans will not achieve anything'."
According to the "Jerusalem Post", a member of Assad's entourage did confirm on Friday night that a handshake with Katsav occurred, and reported this quote by a Syrian Army Radio source saying "the gesture was an expression of manners and has no political significance." Katsav also told Israeli "Channel 2 News" on Friday evening that his handshakes with Assad and Khatami were merely polite gestures and had no implications for the relationships between their countries.

EU accession treaty for Romania published on the Internet

Romania's Ministry of European Integration has made public the text of the European Union's Accession Treaty with Romania and Bulgaria, making it available on its website. The text of the treaty is available freely, in Romanian, at .
The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the European Parliament on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.
The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.
Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.
When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year.

Runners, fans prepare for 109th Boston Marathon

The 109th running of the world's oldest annual marathon, the Boston Marathon, will start in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, at noon on Monday, April 18, 2005. The marathon, one of the few marathons that requires entrants to run below certain times in another marathon to enter, is "tough for the runners" because of the late start time, the Monday start date, and the remote start location, according to Don Allison of Cool Running. Despite the entry requirements and hardships, the marathon is expected to draw over 20,000 runners, 500,000 spectators, and 1000 members of the press.
Race director Dave McGillivray told the Boston Globe that, "We're not the fastest course, we're not the biggest field, we're not the richest purse, but we're the most prestigious." The Globe notes that the Chicago marathon is known for faster times, a purse 50% larger than Boston's, and a field twice as large. Still, in Boston the winning man and woman each receive $100,000 in prize money.
The Boston Marathon is know for the set of 4 hills that runners hit in Newton, a suburb west of Boston. The fourth hill, known as Heartbreak Hill, occurs at the 21-mile mark.

Romanian government to strengthen laws against tax evasion

The Romanian government has drafted legislation pertaining to tax evasion that makes it a criminal offence on the same level as crimes against individuals. Developed with the aid of Romania's business community, the new law is expected to reduce corruption and tax evasion. According to the new law, the maximum jail term for tax evasion will be boosted up to 20 years. This sentence, however, will only be passed in circumstances of large-scale fraud. For evasion of up to the equivalent of 10,000 euro, the punishment will be either a fine or up to 2 years in prison. For tax fraud of up to 500,000 euro, the term will be extended to 2-8 years in prison. It is only for those whose tax evasion exceeds 1 million euro that the jail term will range between 10 and 20 years.
In the same package of legislation, the government approved several changes to banckruptcy law, which makes it easier for businesses to file for bankruptcy. The new laws are expected to make Romania's business environment cleaner, resulting in more foreign investment, less corruption and more revenue for the government.
At the start of the year, the Romanian government introduced a new flat tax system for Romania, in which the tax rate is 19% for both personal income and corporate profit. This has led Romania to have one of the most liberal tax policies in Europe. The lower rate of tax has already reduced fiscal evasion to a significant extent because more people and businesses are encouraged to pay the tax. However, in order to further reduce the grey economy in Romania, advisers said at the start of the year that the government must also back this up with tougher legislation against tax evasion. Previously, Romania's tax evasion laws were fairly lax, leading to quite a significant extent of tax fraud. Now, with the new, highly-publicised tax evasion laws, it is expected that the risk of getting prosecuted for not paying an already-low tax rate will force many businesses out of the black market into the legal economy.

A Romanian been found and declared safe, according to the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Romanian, which has as of yet only been identified by his last name, Dinca, had been kidnapped by soldiers dressed as civilians.
Dinca was the president of Mega Star Congo Company, a Romanian enterprise operating in the DRC. After his kidnapping, one of his employees said that his boss had been kidnapped by military subordinates of a Congolese general who had been watching and following Dinca for the previous two weeks. Other employees confirmed this, saying that Dinca had been watched by groups of soldiers in his home at Gombe. The Romanian Foreign Ministry said that the kidnapping has occurred due to a "private commercial dispute."
Le Phare, a Congolese newspaper, reported that, "This kidnapping, which undermines the actions of the head of state and members of the government members, raises a big question mark, both for the authorities and for the army commanders. If the insecurity is due to the soldiers, it is worrying that such a climate is maintained by superior officers and generals."
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they would continue to try and protect Romanian businessmen who invest in the DRC and prevent similar incidents in the future.

A gathering of more than a thousand medical researchers in , , has been told that and — banned in the 1960s after being linked to gross birth abnormalities — held hope as a basis for new treatments, extending the lives of patients with an so-far incurable bone marrow cancer, .
Diagnosis of the disease has increased by 45% in Australia since 1992. It is the most lethal form of cancer, and the topic of discussion, at the 10th International Myeloma Workshop, continuing until the 16th of April.
The two treatments had advantages over existing treatments, including lessened side-effects, and reducing the need for chemo- and radiotherapy. They may also be usable to treat other illnesses. Both were still under test.
"The development of arsenic dates back many years when it was used for lowering the in patients, even at the turn of the century," Professor Miles Prince, of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, told "" for the 10th International Myeloma Workshop.
"Subsequently [arsenic] was used in China since the 1960s for treating certain forms of Leukaemia," he said.
It could be used to induce the cell to "commit suicide".
"The side effects with Thalidomide are much less than with chemotherapy because it's not damaging innocent bystander cells - so you don't get low blood counts, you don't lose your hair, you don't get a sore mouth," he said.
"It was originally thought to work because [Thalidomide] blocks the blood vessel growth in , and that is still true, but the research that we've done has shown that one of its major causes of action is to stimulate [ ] which are directly against the tumour, and these T-cells help patients with myeloma fight their disease," Professor Douglas Joshua, head of at in Sydney, told Australian radio.

Las Vegas 'chili finger' woman has history of lawsuits

Anna Ayala, the woman who claims to have found the notorious "chili finger" at a outlet in , has filed lawsuits against other businesses, according to researchers at the "Associated Press". Her previous court battles included the national El Pollo Loco chicken-chain, a previous employer, and even General Motors.
Ayala successfully won her suit for medical expenses against El Pollo Loco, after her daughter Genesis contracted salmonella poisoning from eating at the restaurant. However, Ayala lost another suit in 2000 claiming that a wheel fell off her car.
Ayala's original account of the incident spoke "emotionally and with disgust" to the "San Jose Mercury News" when she described it to the paper.
"Lies, lies, lies, that's all I am hearing. They should look at Wendy's. What are they hiding? Why are we being victimized again and again?" Ayala recently told "The Associated Press". Ayala is now in her Las Vegas home, avoiding reporters.
"It doesn't prove anything," family spokesman Ken Bono told the "San Francisco Chronicle". "My mom has 10 lawsuits. A lot of people have lawsuits. Why would she sue for money? She has plenty of money," he said.
Nick Muyo, a spokesman for the San Jose Police department, said not to expect new information in the case for at least a week.
"We just want to step back and take a deep breath," Muyo told "Knight Ridder Newspapers". "From a law enforcement point of view, once you establish it is a human finger, you have to wonder is this a case of industrial accident or is this a case of unreported homicide," he said.
Las Vegas police searched Anna Ayala's home on Wednesday, retrieving a cooler and other effects from her home, such as a makeup case.
Aftermath.
Despite the incident, which has dramatically reduced sales at Northern California Wendy's outlets, die-hard Wendy's fans are still turning up for lunch, even at the outlet where the finger was found, at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose.
"We've eaten here for years," a police officer told the "San Francisco Chronicle" under the condition that he remain anonymous. "They're very nice people. When we work Spartan Stadium, we always eat here," he said.
San Jose City Council candidate Andrew Diaz still eats the chili. And he witnessed the finger discovery.
"I walked away real slow," Diaz told the "San Francisco Chronicle". "I didn't want any commotion," he said.

'Sahara' opens as top film in U.S., Canada

Moviegoers who pushed it to No. 1 with a reported $18.1 million take for the weekend ending April 10 at the U.S. and Canadian box office welcomed the premiere of the movie "Sahara", starring Matthew McConaughey and Penélope Cruz. Still, the total was $10 million less than "Sin City", the top film of the previous week, made in its debut.
"Sahara" is described as an adventure movie with plenty of fun. McConaughey plays a tanned and fit traveler searching for a long lost U.S. Civil War battleship, filled with gold coins, and finds love in the process.
"Sin City", starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, dropped to second place but was still doing well with a $14.1 million dollar sophomore weekend. Filling out the top shows: "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous", which falls from #5 to #7 with more than $4.1 million "The Pacifier," which drops from #6 to #8 with more than $3 million; "The Ring Two", from #7 to #9 with $2.9 million; and "The Upside of Anger," from #8 to #10 with $2.6 million.
Ticket sales at all box offices showed a decline from last year for the same weekend.
